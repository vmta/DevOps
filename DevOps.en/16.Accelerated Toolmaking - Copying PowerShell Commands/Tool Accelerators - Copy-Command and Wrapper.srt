1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,588
So let's, let me see my next demo. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here.

2
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:12,588
We're going to come back. I'm going to do another version of this so you can see again the before and after.

3
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:18,588
So that's Get-CommandMetadata, which is designed to create basically a rapid way of creating a proxy function

4
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:24,588
that you can then modify. I realize that I want to go more that.

5
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:32,588
I may want a wrapper function where I don't want the proxy, I'm probably still going to call the underlying

6
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:38,588
command, but for whatever reason, I want to build a wrapper around it, but again, I don't want to have to try

7
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:41,588
to find all the parameters and retype them and the help and all of that.

8
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:42,588
So I built

9
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:52,588
a second version of my script and I'm going to close some of these things here.

10
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:59,588
This tool actually is on GitHub. So my GitHub repo is jdhitsolutions.

11
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:06,588
There's also a link on my blog or ping me on Twitter if you can't find it.

12
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:21,588
So let's see this is this command. We'll just hide the help. I also realize in after I finished that first

13
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:28,588
function that even though it was getting rid of forwarded help, well there may be some instances where I do

14
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:33,588
want to use forwarded help because I'm still going to create a new version of Get-Service.

15
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:41,588
It's going to override and I'm still going to call it Get-Service and I want to show the forwarded help.

16
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:46,588
I want to be able to include that as an option. So I have a parameter there with switch,

17
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:53,588
so I go ahead and use it if it's there, so basically don't delete it.

18
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:59,588
The default behavior for this command is to create a wrapper function

19
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:10,588
or I can use that as proxy and it's going to do the same, a lot of the same code that I just showed you is in this command.

20
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:33,588
The big differences here, this forwarded help, is that as I go through, again I'm building a here string,

21
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:38,588
and if I'm specifying a proxy command, then it will go in and add the proxy

22
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:46,588
pieces, otherwise, it just uses the different commands that I showed you with that proxy object,

23
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:53,588
the proxy command class, to get the different pieces that I want and then manually paste them in.

24
00:02:53,588 --> 00:03:11,588
The difference being, so I'm entering the parameters, the big difference is when I define here on Line 220

25
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:16,588
that process, that is what will show up in the eventual command that I'm creating.

26
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:22,588
So I can either create the proxy version of it or I can just build a wrapper

27
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:29,588
that's going to run the command and then splat PSBoundParameters, at least as a starting point.

28
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:37,588
You'll see some of my examples again before and after where I go a little bit further than that.

29
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:44,588
And even in my copied commands, you'll notice I'm inserting write-verbose commands, so you have no choice,

30
00:03:44,588 --> 00:04:06,588
but to use them. Alright, so let's see how this works in action.

31
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:20,588
Alright, let's clear that. So I'm going to run Get-Command, again with Get-VM called Get-MyVM -IncludeDynamic -AsProxy.

32
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:28,588
This is basically, this will give me nope, no, no, no, no, no don't run the script.

33
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:40,588
Now I need to do. (Typing) For those of you whoever do presentations like I'm doing where you're walking

34
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:46,588
through a script, and I never do it, put a return keyword at the very beginning of your script file

35
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:52,588
that you're walking through. So if you do it like I did and accidentally hit F5, it'll hit return and then stop.

36
00:04:52,588 --> 00:05:02,588
It won't run through all of my demo. I busted many a demo by not putting that in.

37
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:12,588
Alright, so we are going to create basically recreate that proxy version of Get-VM.

38
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:21,588
A few differences, I've inserted a little header metadata so it shows who created this and some copy of what

39
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,588
command, who created it, when they created it, I know, I just personally I find that useful.

40
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:35,588
I put in my standard disclaimer. I'm using the help. Help has all been modified.

41
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:42,588
Oh, this version I fixed my issues with the parameters, so now I've got everything in line with the way that

42
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,588
I want it to be. I have all

43
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:57,588
of the parameter sets and the names. And now I have the Begin, Process, and End ScriptBlocks just like we

44
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:07,588
had before with a proxy command. I can go through and modify this as necessary.

45
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:20,588
So what I did, let's just, so this is the before. So you can see I have all the parameters that I would have

46
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:33,588
running Get-VM and this is the after. So I'm going to reach in the oven, pull out the finished cake,

47
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:46,588
which in, make sure I'm on the right line here, yeah. So in this case, I went through and cleaned up the help

48
00:06:46,588 --> 00:07:01,588
a little bit. It's always easier to delete stuff and then just copy and paste in my new examples.

49
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:07,588
Oh this copy command script, that function, will also detect

50
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:13,588
if the command that you are copying comes from a module, it will make that a requirement.

51
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:15,588
So it detected that this

52
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:22,588
was not from one of the standard out-of-the-box Microsoft.PowerShell modules and requires Hyper-V,

53
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:26,588
so it automatically inserts that for you.

54
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:31,588
Remember lazy.

55
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:41,588
I don't want to have to think too much. So the reason that I wrote this particular command is I use Hyper-V

56
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,588
all the time

57
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,588
and I'm running Get-VM, but I want to know what VMs are running.

58
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:53,588
I'm tired of having to type Get-VM, type it to Where-Object, where the State equals, so I just want a version

59
00:07:53,588 --> 00:08:04,588
of Get-VM that has a parameter, I can't remember what I called it now and I can't see that, called state,

60
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:13,588
State= Running, so I've made that the default. You'll also notice and this once you go to add stuff,

61
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:19,588
yeah that's where you've got to earn your paycheck, so I did a little work and I discovered the class

62
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:26,588
name for that state is that, is an Enum. The advantage is, instead of making that a string or anything,

63
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:30,588
by going that route and identifying the enumeration,

64
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:36,588
I get IntelliSense. Okay. How cool is that?

65
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:44,588
So that is a new parameter that Get-VM doesn't know about, so here's how we fix that.

66
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:56,588
So I have some verbose messages. I remove that state parameter, right, because Get-VM is not going to know

67
00:08:56,588 --> 00:09:07,588
that from PSBoundParameters and then I, this is a really simple version that's why I'm showing it to you,

68
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:15,588
I then modify the script command, basically say go ahead and run the initial command, but then filter it to

69
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,588
where object State= Running. So I don't

70
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:27,588
have to rely on having to type that all out. I can give this someone else and they want to say find me all

71
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:35,588
the VMs that are paused, they can do that without having to understand how to pipe to where and know what to type

72
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:41,588
because we've got the IntelliSense it's all braindead simple.

73
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:48,588
That command that wrapped that script command then gets thrown to the pipeline.

74
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:56,588
Everything else in Get-VM works just fine the way I expect it to be.

75
00:09:56,588 --> 00:10:10,588
Now what I don't know, oh let's see if that even works. (Working)

76
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:20,588
Well let's do this here first just to show you. So get help. So all the parameters and stuff are copied over

77
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:31,588
from Get-VM and you can see my state parameter and

78
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:37,588
because I had that enum, PowerShell automatically expands all of that and shows me all the possible options.

79
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:41,588
Kind of handy.

80
00:10:41,588 --> 00:11:02,588
And in my description I say that it's a copy. (Typing) Now what I don't know is if I can see on the network,

81
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:15,588
let's find out here, there's my verbose, oh good it worked. Because I'm going, because this virtual machine

82
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:16,588
I'm running is trying

83
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:23,588
to connect to the Hyper-V host, which is my laptop itself and when you present and the way I have to stuff it

84
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:27,588
up so I have a switch to make sure the networking all works and good it worked.

85
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,588
So I didn't have to do

86
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:44,588
anything and now I have all running VMs, -State. So

87
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:51,588
very easily, I just created a copy of Get-VM, made my little tweaks,

88
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:57,588
tweaked the help, done. It didn't take nearly as long as if I had started

89
00:11:57,588 --> 00:12:04,588
with an empty ps1 file and manually had to type all that stuff out.

90
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:13,588
Questions over and this is kind of a one-way ways you would use a proxy function.

91
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:16,588
I'm still calling the underlying command,

92
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:20,588
but I have tweaked it in a way, in this case, I've added a parameter.

93
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:29,588
Yeah. (Audience Comment) So let's say like Get-ADUser, do you always want it to be -prompt department title

94
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:38,588
in edge or something, but so you're wrapping or you're doing it, now you're setting the whole value of the

95
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:45,588
parameter that already exists. How would you go about wrapping it?

96
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:50,588
He could use PS default parameter values and then you don't have to deal with…

97
00:12:50,588 --> 00:13:02,588
Yeah, no he's saying if I'm building a new command and I want to set a, well yeah, it should override that or

98
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:10,588
you can just explicitly in your command because you can still splat something and specify additional parameters.

99
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:15,588
It's not an either/or situation. What about these other ones that you sort have been provided because properties

100
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:20,588
have showed they have to set other things and you're also setting that override to that.

101
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:23,588
What, are you talking about the properties on the underlying as a user object?

102
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:36,588
(Audience comment) Right. And so you said that your wrapper showed this specific value, but it's like calling

103
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:42,588
it also tries to set that. What happens? It depends on how you've written your command.

104
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:49,588
Hold on to that thought. I have some Active Directory examples we'll get to later.

105
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:56,588
Maybe you'll see something there that will answer that. (Audience comment)

106
00:13:56,588 --> 00:14:02,588
They shouldn't be able to override anything unless they open up the script file and modify it.

107
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:09,588
All they're going to do is see your command. Right, I don't see how that's the way to write that to make it

108
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:17,588
work that way. Well you would just modify the help and assign, for example, here what I could do,

109
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:27,588
let's go back to my I need, even though this is default, I set a default to the computer name, let's say I

110
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:40,588
know that my, let's see if this will work. I know that my Hyper-V host is Chi-p50.

111
00:14:40,588 --> 00:15:11,588
Let's reload that. Invalid class. Oh, that may be an issue. Let's put in, so we're going off the off-script

112
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:19,588
right now, but that's fine. That's how we learn things. I can't type and talk at the same time.

113
00:15:19,588 --> 00:16:03,588
(Typing) I also hope that I'm running the right version of this. (Typing)

114
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,588
It's not passing through the computer name, which this is what someone was asking earlier.

115
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:25,588
So let's because I didn't specify, so the PSBoundParameters, so what I might have to do then is and I don't

116
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:37,588
want to totally delete, I don't want to totally ruin my command here, but maybe I will.

117
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:50,588
We're going to do this. I'm going to, let's just comment out this parameter just because I don't want to

118
00:16:50,588 --> 00:17:00,588
have to modify my original command too much because this is kind of what you were talking about with the properties, right?

119
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:03,588
I want for my command computer name

120
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:12,588
to always be ChicagoP50. So I don't want to even make that an option for them, so I remove that from the parameter.

121
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:15,588
So now what I can do here

122
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:35,588
is I could add it, so let's do that. We'll just do PSBoundParameters Add Computername, right?

123
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:45,588
And I should see that because I'm adding that before I display it.

124
00:17:45,588 --> 00:18:00,588
Let's clear this here. There we go. I'm not quite sure. Oh, because I have some additional code in there

125
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:07,588
That's still relying on the Computername, so that's, but so that's what you could do.

126
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:17,588
You would just remove from your version of Get-ADUser and then just hardcode in whatever other

127
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:27,588
commands you want. Would another way of doing that be to examine the collection that you could use the value

128
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:35,588
of the properties. Sure, I mean if you want you could leave properties in there and if it doesn't have,

129
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:45,588
yeah, then you could add something. So an example is make sure that those three always give up regardless

130
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,588
what else they have in the process. Right, a couple different ways that

131
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:59,588
you could do that. Alright, let's move on here because I'm amazed an hour has gone by already.

132
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:18,588
Or this is another version of Get-MyVM. Parameters and stuff are all the same, except this is now a wrapper function.

133
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:22,588
So it's not a proxy, so basically all I'm doing is saying take whatever parameters come through

134
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:31,588
PSBoundParameters and they're splatted in the process block and that's it.

135
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:40,588
It took like no time to create an entire working function. Can you go back into the line you were…?

136
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:43,588
Show me which line? The line that you select to amortize that.

137
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:51,588
Oh, to create this?

138
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:59,588
So I just ran my command, my copy command function, so that's when I can get VM, the NewName, include dynamic just

139
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:08,588
in case, done. (Audience comment) Yeah, the proxy, if you do it as proxy, then it creates a proxy command

140
00:20:08,588 --> 00:20:15,588
version with a step-able pipeline and the wrap stuff. (Audience Comment)

141
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:21,588
Right, the first command, Get-CommandMetadata that I wrote just does proxy functions only.

142
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,588
This version Copy-Command because that's what it does.

143
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:31,588
It allows me to copy an existing command and I can either create a proxy version of it or a wrapper version

144
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:34,588
of it, which kind of brings me

145
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:43,588
to my next question, can talk about which is better. Why would I want to use a proxy function and maybe why

146
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:51,588
would I want to use a wrapper? Anyone? Yeah, well what you're doing if you don't use the step-able thing,

147
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:57,588
I think you actually can go through the inside command multiple times, but the behavior's not always going to

148
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:03,588
be the same. Okay. Which may or may not be, depending on what you need

149
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:08,588
accomplished, that's something. And that's why I want to have this quick little discussion here as to because

150
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:15,588
there may or may not, actually the only way you're going to know which is the right version is to probably do

151
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:23,588
both and test. It may also depend on how much you need to add or delete.

152
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:28,588
Do you need to put in stuff, I have to ensure that these certain things are met.

153
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:36,588
How much more difficult is that?

154
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:43,588
Proxy function I find a little harder to troubleshoot because everything's kind of nested in those step-able

155
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:51,588
pipelines versus a wrapper function. I mean if you look at the wrapper versions that we just created in

156
00:21:51,588 --> 00:22:09,588
Untitled7, and my mouse, this is really simple. So there are a number of things that you have to, again,

157
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:12,588
and also think about who's going to use the command.

158
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:23,588
Are you going to be piping stuff to it? Will they need access to other commands or they may be part of like

159
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:29,588
the Get-VM stuff, I don't know. So you have to kind of make those decisions, but I have a tool now that you

160
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:34,588
can use to go both ways and you

161
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:42,588
can decide and it does not take very long to create something totally new.

162
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:57,588
So here is the finished version of Get-MyVM2. This is the wrapper version.

163
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:12,588
So in this case, I hardcoded in the computer name, I removed the state because Get-VM doesn't understand that,

164
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:25,588
and I'm not sure I tested this when I created this just the other day, so let's test it.

165
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,588
The default behavior

166
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:35,588
should be able to display all the running virtual machines on ChicagoP50.

167
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:43,588
And again, I didn't put in my, oh let's do this with verbose because I bet I'm having that same issue with

168
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:52,588
the PSBoundParameters. Oh, not clear screen verbose, that's kind of silly.

169
00:23:52,588 --> 00:24:00,588
(Audience comment) Yeah. Okay, so yeah that's why you've got to test everything and I

170
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:06,588
modified it, but I never went back and tested it. So I need to go through and do the same things I did before.

171
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:12,588
I'll probably just get rid of computer, well no because I still want to give them the option, but I want it to

172
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:21,588
default, so I need to do some other magic, so I'll tweak this before I publish it or share it with all my demo stuff.

173
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:30,588
You can see how I solve that. Because in this particular case, I want them to be able to specify something else

174
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:39,588
in addition, but have it default to the current one, so I'll have to go back and look at that.

175
00:24:39,588 --> 00:59:59,999
Alright.
