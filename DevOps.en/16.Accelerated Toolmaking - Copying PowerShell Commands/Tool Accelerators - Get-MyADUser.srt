1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,223
let's run, take a look at Get-MyADUser. So I wrote this function.

2
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:22,223
This is a, let's just hide the help here, and this was created using my copy command for Get-ADUser and it

3
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:31,223
automatically got all of the default parameters because from being dynamic.

4
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:39,223
Most of these should look the same, except I made a few changes, one, I wanted to be able to search for users in

5
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:49,223
multiple OUs. The default for Get-ADUser, the search base only takes a single string.

6
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:53,223
I wanted multiple locations, so I modified

7
00:00:53,223 --> 00:01:03,223
if you can see there and put in take an array. Why not? Who's in charge here, you know?

8
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:17,223
And I also wanted the ability to exclude user accounts by some pattern.

9
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,223
And you'll see I'll do a demo here, so you can see how that works.

10
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:31,223
Everything else is pretty much copied over from Get-ADUser. What I had to do was remove the parameters that

11
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:45,223
Get-ADUser doesn't know about like exclude. Now it knows about search base, but what I ended up doing here,

12
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:51,223
now this is not a proxy function, this is a wrapper, so here's a reason and one of the reasons I did this was

13
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:57,223
because notice I have a foreach that's basically looping through

14
00:01:57,223 --> 00:02:07,223
the collection of OUs. That would be really hard to do in that step-able pipeline thing trying to piece that out.

15
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:17,223
This is much easier, at least for me. (Audience question) Actually, I think I wrote this someone posted

16
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:23,223
something in a forum and they were trying to search for users in multiple locations.

17
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:29,223
Why wouldn't they just not specify the script base? Because they didn't want to search the entire Active

18
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:38,223
Directory OU, so they've got 100,000 users, but all they care about, the user could be in one of three OUs,

19
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:45,223
which limits them to maybe only searching a 1,000 user accounts, so they wanted a way to fine tune and

20
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:52,223
restrict where they searched. Does this work meaningfully different than simply putting my script bases in

21
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:56,223
strings and then iterating in a foreach block and calling Get-ADUser?

22
00:02:56,223 --> 00:03:04,223
You could do that too. Exactly. But that requires you to have more knowledge of how PowerShell were to work.

23
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:10,223
This runs faster than something like that or if itsâ€¦ I don't know if it necessarily runs faster,

24
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:18,223
but it's easier to type, to run the command because I just have to run Get-MyADUser and specify the parameters.

25
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:24,223
So all I'm doing is hiding all of, yes, what you could do manually.

26
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:30,223
There's not necessarily a performance gain in terms of getting the end result.

27
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,223
It's just a matter of

28
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:38,223
ease of use for whoever might need to use this tool.

29
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:49,223
So actually let's see if this is going to work. So let's dot source that.

30
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:54,223
Okay, so I had, now this does require the Active Directory module.

31
00:03:54,223 --> 00:04:03,223
Now if I look at help for Get-ADUser, the original command, you'll notice original parameter for exclude, right.

32
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:16,223
Nothing up my fancy sleeves here. But my version, my copy version, does have and I added help for it,

33
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:23,223
which you should be doing, and you can also, I'm going to compare some parameters.

34
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:32,223
So I'm going to get the parameters for Get-ADUser and my Get-MyADUser.

35
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:37,223
It's another way if you want to prove what's different between two things.

36
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:49,223
Alright, so exclude is the only difference. Although, I know for a fact that search base is different.

37
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:52,223
So search base in the original is just a string and

38
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:59,223
in my version you can see it's a collection of strings. That's just kind of to prove things.

39
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:08,223
So I'm going to build a hash table. I want to filter on, I'm going to find all user accounts where the department

40
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:15,223
is equal to engineering. I want to search in either of the employees or the research engineering locations

41
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:27,223
and that's it. And I want to get the title and department back. So let's, this is not using the exclude piece.

42
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:37,223
If I were to do this and splat that to Get-ADUser that fails because the search base says hey you're

43
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:43,223
trying to tell me to do more than I'm designed to do.

44
00:05:43,223 --> 00:06:00,223
Fine. Be that way. I'm in control. There's the result. So I searched using Get-ADUser and I wrote my own

45
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,223
little code

46
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:06,223
very quickly that, when I made the copy of the command, the only code I had come up with was really just that

47
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:12,223
little bit in the process block. All the other boring mundane stuff, which you have to have anyway,

48
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,223
I copied over.

49
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:24,223
So and that ran pretty quickly considering I have like 5,000 plus user accounts in my domain, and if you want

50
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:37,223
to see how the exclude works, so I want to find all users in the domain, except, oh so the exclude is

51
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:48,223
actually for a particular container, I want to find all users that have a name like Joseph, but skip anything

52
00:06:48,223 --> 00:07:02,223
that's in a testing OU because Get-ADUser has no way to do that and that's actually probably a more typical use case.

53
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:12,223
I want to find something, but I want to ignore, there's no easy way to do that with Get-ADUser.

54
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:22,223
It would take a long complicated command, so but I put that in.

55
00:07:22,223 --> 00:59:59,999
Another before and after.
