00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,409
And the last thing I was going to talk about, but I'm now at the end is some advanced

2
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:12,909
scenarios, which are brand new to DebugPX and you guys can take a look at and ask questions about if you want

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:19,909
to dig into them, in particular, to what you were talking about setting that debugger hidden attribute.

4
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:23,909
If it's on code you don't own, but you want to set that, you can do it with this.

5
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:26,909
So I have this Set-CommandDebug mode and I can turn it on for an entire module.

6
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:31,909
So if I'm debugging and calling code that calls other modules that I don't want to debug, I can basically say

7
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:36,909
turn the debugging off for that module, so then I can set breakpoints whether they're command breakpoints or

8
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:43,909
variable breakpoints and steps through only my stuff and take the other stuff as if it's a black box and

9
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,909
don't touch it. So it's very handy as well because you're often consuming, especially with PowerShell gallery,

10
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,909
you download script modules, you run them, and you don't want to debug those, you want to debug your code

11
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:57,909
that's running those, hopefully, unless they're not very well written modules.

12
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,909
So that's all I've got today. If you guys have more questions, I will be around all week.

13
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:07,909
I'm happy to pull, go aside, and talk about some of things in more detail or you can contact me through

14
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,909
on my slide deck, which you will receive. This is a link to the modules I talked about and

15
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:17,909
this is my contact information for reaching out to me, so feel free to contact me any time.

16
00:01:17,909 --> 00:59:59,999
I'm happy to help.
