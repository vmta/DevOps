Okay, hi everybody. Thanks for coming. I did already push the button, so you don't have to ask to make sure.

2
00:00:21,5 --> 00:00:27,5
I want to talk to you guys today about something that I spend a lot of time doing, which is debugging PowerShell.

3
00:00:27,5 --> 00:00:38,5
I've been working with PowerShell for 10 years now and I worked on, in past lifetimes, Power GUI as an evangelist

4
00:00:38,5 --> 00:00:42,5
and then later on as an architect and as a product manager

5
00:00:42,5 --> 00:00:48,5
and I used to work on Power WF and Power SD, so I've been working on PowerShell and PowerShell tools for

6
00:00:48,5 --> 00:00:53,5
quite a long time, especially in the past with the tool side of the fence.

7
00:00:53,5 --> 00:01:00,5
And so through all that work, I've done a lot of debugging and I've come up with a lot of tips and tricks

8
00:01:00,5 --> 00:01:09,5
that I use and I'm constantly, I guess the curious side of me is always creating, I think looking for ways to

9
00:01:09,5 --> 00:01:13,5
create new tools that make debugging even easier and tinker around with how things work under the covers and

10
00:01:13,5 --> 00:01:18,5
finding cool solutions that weren't necessarily readily available before.

11
00:01:18,5 --> 00:01:21,5
So the talk I want to give today is about sharing of that back with you.

12
00:01:21,5 --> 00:01:28,5
All of the content that I'm sharing here works on PowerShell V3 and later, so this is not bleeding edge

13
00:01:28,5 --> 00:01:32,5
latest and greatest, you have to have V5, otherwise it's no good to you.

14
00:01:32,5 --> 00:01:36,5
If you're using version 3 or later, anything I talk about here, you guys are going to be able to use,

15
00:01:36,5 --> 00:01:42,5
unless I call it something and specifically from a new version, in which case I'll highlight that, but in general

16
00:01:42,5 --> 00:01:44,5
that's the way that I'm going to roll with this.

17
00:01:44,5 --> 00:01:50,5
So who am I? My name's Kirk Munro. I go by the nickname, Poshoholic.

18
00:01:50,5 --> 00:01:55,5
If you want to contact me, that's my Twitter handle, poshoholic.com, poshoholic@gmail.com,

19
00:01:55,5 --> 00:02:01,5
poshoholic@hotmail.com, you kind of get the drift. If you want to look for me somewhere around the web,

20
00:02:01,5 --> 00:02:05,5
just look for that handle and then you can find me and reach out to me.

21
00:02:05,5 --> 00:02:12,5
I work for, these days, by the way, I work for a company called Provance Technologies, which is we specialize

22
00:02:12,5 --> 00:02:19,5
in IT solutions management and I'm a technical product manager there still doing a lot of PowerShell in that space.

23
00:02:19,5 --> 00:02:24,5
I've been with them for the past three years and just doing PowerShell as well on the

24
00:02:24,5 --> 00:02:28,5
side as a hobby and passion at home.

25
00:02:28,5 --> 00:02:36,5
So the agenda is just talking about a collection of PowerShell modules that I've written that help make

26
00:02:36,5 --> 00:02:42,5
debugging and defensive scripting easier, some tips and tricks, recommendations, best practices,

27
00:02:42,5 --> 00:02:48,5
things you can avoid, and hopefully, you'll come out of this a bit more enlightened in some of the things you

28
00:02:48,5 --> 00:02:54,5
might run into in debugging your own work, and so that it'll ring a bell when you run into it later and maybe

29
00:02:54,5 --> 00:03:01,5
think of some of these solutions and ideas and be able to get through your issues more quickly.

30
00:03:01,5 --> 00:03:06,5
And because it's about debugging, I can't really teach about debugging PowerShell from a slide deck,

31
00:03:06,5 --> 00:03:13,5
so all the content that I'm going to do from here on is going to be in PowerShell ISE and doing demos because

32
00:03:13,5 --> 00:03:16,5
it's going to make learning it a lot easier to see firsthand.

33
00:03:16,5 --> 00:03:22,5
By the way, any questions that anybody has, don't feel you have to save them for the end.

34
00:03:22,5 --> 00:03:26,5
Interrupt me at any time. If I don't see you, just speak up and grab my attention.

35
00:03:26,5 --> 00:03:29,5
I don't have this scripted down to the wire and timed to the last minute.

36
00:03:29,5 --> 00:03:34,5
I leave breathing room for working with the audience and if there are particular things you want me to drill in

37
00:03:34,5 --> 00:03:39,5
deeper on or have questions about, bring it up and I'll see where I can fit it and how I can handle it.

38
00:03:39,5 --> 00:03:44,5
And if I can't handle it here or can't answer the questions here, I'll be happy to do research and figure out

39
00:03:44,5 --> 00:59:59,999
or talk to you after the fact in one of the side rooms or in the hall and see what I can do to help as well.
