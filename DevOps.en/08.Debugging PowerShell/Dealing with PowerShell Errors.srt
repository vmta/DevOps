00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,299
So debugging PowerShell is an interesting thing because debugging PowerShell often starts, well always pretty

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:12,299
much starts with dealing with errors. And when dealing with errors,

3
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:18,299
it doesn't really matter who or what level of experience the people who are using PowerShell have.

4
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:25,299
Most people get really hung up on the notion of red error text where you'll find very seasoned people working

5
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:29,299
in the industry for a long time, maybe even have done scripting, they run a command that you gave them,

6
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:35,299
and they say it's red and that's all that they give you. They just it's errored, it's red, and in the error text,

7
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:39,299
if they look at it, the actual solution the text is right there in front of them it tells them specifically

8
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,299
what was wrong and so you walk over to the screen and you tell them how to decipher that error text as part

9
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:50,299
of the debugging steps and then you kind of start getting them beyond that, but some people like to actually

10
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:57,299
change the color by default through GPOs and what not, scripts, profile scripts just because it can make

11
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,299
things easier for people. So I'm just going to

12
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,299
load a helper function here first and you're going to see me flip back and forth a lot between this view and

13
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:11,299
the other one as I run stuff, so if you want me to jump back to something that you want me to explain or detail,

14
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:18,299
let me know. So here's just a simple example showing a typical error.

15
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,299
There's a lot of detail in here that's really useful, in particular, this is the kind of example where

16
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,299
somebody might just come to you with an error because it failed and says it can't find the path and you go

17
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,299
over to the machine and you say well it can't find the path because it says it can't find the path,

18
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,299
and so this is the kind of thing that you can run into even when working with seasoned pros.

19
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:46,299
So changing up the color is easy. If you're working in ISE, there's psISE.Options.ErrorForegroundColor,

20
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,299
so you can change the color to something that you like a little bit better and I mean that's blue on blue

21
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,299
so that's not a great example. Here's another one. You've got a wide variety with

22
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:01,299
System.Windows.Media.Colors to pick the color that you want makes it a lot easier, and actually just even

23
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:06,299
being experienced with PowerShell and reading through the texts through many, many years now,

24
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,299
switching the color makes a difference for me too. It's a small thing, it's seems silly, but it makes a

25
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:14,299
difference throwing this in your profile script and just using it for a little while, you might start

26
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:19,299
realizing that the text that's in the error message does pop out more and you start noticing more things that

27
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:31,299
are in it, so it's a cool technique to follow. Now something else you can do with error messages is so how

28
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,299
many people here are aware that there's more than one error category view or error view, I guess, one more way

29
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:42,299
that you can view error messages, only---I saw one person half raise their hand, so not many people.

30
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:49,299
So by default, when you look at error messages and you see text like this and the green down here, this is the

31
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:55,299
normal error view where you're going to see some detail text messages and some line and character positions

32
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,299
inside of the script that ran category information. You can also change the view to what's known as a

33
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:08,299
CategoryView, which is a much more terse view. So if I get that exact same error message in this CategoryView,

34
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,299
you can see here, all it's showing me is what's hidden inside of category info in the view above.

35
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:21,299
So if I select this text right here on this line, this is what it's showing me in the CategoryView and all

36
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:28,299
you do is you set this global variable to ErrorView = CategoryView and you get a more terse format, which is good

37
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,299
if you're experienced because it can get to the point more quickly sometimes and especially

38
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:39,299
if you're looking at the entire error variable a many, many errors one after another, this can just give you

39
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:47,299
a line by line, so you can scan it for things. So that's a good tip; however, the CategoryView and the

40
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,299
category information isn't always descriptive enough to tell you what's going on.

41
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,299
I mean, in this case, it's pretty simple because the error type is ItemNotFoundException.

42
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:03,299
You can see that the error message contains the path, so it really tells you, but there are cases where it's

43
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,299
more obtuse trying to figure out what's going on from the CategoryView, in which case, you can just flip it

44
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:21,299
back to ErrorView = NormalView, or technically, you can do ErrorView = Anything at all and anything at all,

45
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:32,299
it'll go back to the, let me run that command again, it goes back to the normal view for anything beyond CategoryView.

46
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:39,299
So inside of this logic that PowerShell uses, it's basically just searching for this string else NormalView,

47
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:44,299
so it doesn't really matter what you set it to. If you forget NormalView, just that it's something other

48
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:51,299
than CategoryView and you'll be good. If you're so inclined and you want to take a round with more error views,

49
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:58,299
there really should be more, I had written more. Small side story, I was installing software on my laptop

50
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:02,299
one day, running out of space quickly as I was installing Visual Studio.

51
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:06,299
Rather than cancelling the installation, which would have been the smarter thing to do and cleaning things

52
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:10,299
up and then installing the product afterwards, I decided I'll frantically go around and clean up some stuff

53
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:17,299
while it's installing. And so then I found myself holding down Shift+Delete on my keyboard while I was looking

54
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:26,299
at my Windows Explorer with my Modules folder selected. Ask myself, what do I do now?

55
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:32,299
And pressing Escape didn't dawn on me in that moment, and so I let it delete and tried using some delete recovery

56
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:39,299
tools to pull stuff back and I was able to get back 95% between that and things I'd emailed other people,

57
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:46,299
but I lost a little bit of content that way. So that's one argument for using version control.

58
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:51,299
But one of the things I lost was I had a module that allowed me to define some more error views and I had

59
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:56,299
some cool stuff and I haven't yet pulled that back in yet, but I intend to.

60
00:05:56,299 --> 00:06:01,299
If you have things that you would like to see in error text by default that aren't there, let me know because

61
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:07,299
it's on my to do list to I don't know where I'll get to it, but it's in my short list of things I think about,

62
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:11,299
and so I think there really should be more views, so just please let me know.

63
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:16,299
My email address is right here. And by the way, all these scripts, I will share them so you don't have to

64
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:20,299
jot stuff down directly from here if you don't want to because you're going to get the content afterwards,

65
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:27,299
as well as the slides, as limited as they are. Beyond ErrorViews and the color, and this is going to sound

66
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:33,299
silly, but has anybody heard the expression talk to the bear? (Audience comment)

67
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:39,299
Yeah, same idea. So you've got a rubber duck, or your bear, or your Xamarin monkey, or whatever other stuffed

68
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:44,299
animal you keep hidden in your office put it on your desk when you have a problem and explain that problem

69
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:50,299
to it because a large percent of the time, you're going to find the solution to that problem by just

70
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:56,299
reiterating it yourself. So people who talk aloud, it actually does work.

71
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:00,299
So there's a reason why people talk to themselves and that's one.

72
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:05,299
And it's surprising. I mean how many people have had a question related to an issue and you go walk over to

73
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:11,299
a coworker an you're asking that question and as you're asking them, the light bulb comes on and you know the

74
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,299
answer to that question right? That's what the talking to the bear is.

75
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:20,299
So it's just about verbalizing what's in your mind already, so that you can release it and put it in front of

76
00:07:20,299 --> 00:59:59,999
yourself by saying it and finding the solution.
