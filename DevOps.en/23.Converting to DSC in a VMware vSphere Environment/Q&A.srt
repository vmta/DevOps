1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,3
Anymore questions? Yes, Josh.

2
00:00:03,3 --> 00:00:08,8
Those folders are inherently designed to obtain things.

3
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:08,5
Yes.

4
00:00:08,5 --> 00:00:16,215
Do you also have resources for maintaining that alignment so that virtual machines that could be in a

5
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:22,215
specific folder do not get moved to other locations because from an operation standpoint, that's what I see

6
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:29,215
happening is someone inadvertently when they're selecting it and then drag it to another folder and lose it.

7
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:37,215
Yeah. That's a good. Josh wants to know if the location in your vSphere inventory, if that is or can be controlled

8
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:48,215
by DSC and yes it can, of course. If we look at one of the earlier slides, let me pull it up again.

9
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:54,215
Okay, if you remember that slide from earlier on in the presentation, this part at the right, that is in fact

10
00:00:54,215 --> 00:01:00,215
the location that you want to look at and what you are asking, if I understand the question correctly,

11
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:08,215
if somebody would move your VM from Folder2 to Folder3, for example, now with the VM in the configuration

12
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:12,215
definition, in the configuration file for the VM, we will have this path.

13
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:17,215
Path will always be there. That's why I'm stressing that obtaining this path is quite important in this

14
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:26,215
complete DSC setup. If DSC LCM agent sees that your path is not correct anymore, you will automatically get

15
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:31,215
the set call and that should correct it. So what we will have in that case, if it fails on the test of the

16
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:39,215
path, you will generate a move to that folder. Same goes not only for folders, but also for datastores,

17
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:42,215
for example, or even clusters for your VM.

18
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:52,215
So ultimately, your DSC LCM could be even, in fact, vMotioning, SVMotioning machines to comply with the

19
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:59,215
configuration that you defined in your configuration files. So it can go very far in the end.

20
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:05,215
There are some tricks, there are some things that I need to resolve because you have to take into account

21
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:12,215
high availability, for example. You're not going to specify that a VM should run on a specific ESXi node.

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:17,215
There are some cases where you perhaps would be inclined to do that.

23
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:22,215
I'm thinking of those VMs and I, at least, have them in my environment.

24
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:27,215
Some of you probably where people have applications that still require a dongle or something like that.

25
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,215
(Audience comment)

26
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:33,215
Or yeah, something like that. You need to fix it on a specific VM ESXi node.

27
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:40,215
There you would need to override what HHA is trying to do with your environment, so it's a bit complex on that level.

28
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,215
Yeah.

29
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:47,215
Would it make more sense to just create DSC resources to manage the DRS rules and make sure those DR rules

30
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:53,215
are in place, so if someone changes a DR rule, it adds a rule back.

31
00:02:53,215 --> 00:03:01,215
Yeah, so DRS, the cluster configuration in vSphere has an option DRS and in DRS you can specify rules where

32
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:06,215
you can create affinities those VMs should be running on those ESXi nodes.

33
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:12,215
Yes, I fully agree, but that is more on the level of vSphere management.

34
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:19,215
You should be managing that in any case, but rules. Now those rules in itself, you can configure with your DSC configuration.

35
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:26,215
That is something that I will add on the cluster resource. We shouldn't rely on only the DSC configuration

36
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:30,215
to define the configuration. I fully agree that it should be in the rules.

37
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:32,215
Correct. Thanks. Good question.

38
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:42,215
Honestly, I think that is an extremely valuable use case because we still see a lot of people who are running

39
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:48,215
applications like Oracle or even SQL Server where you're paying like per socket or things like that.

40
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:55,215
Being able to not only say that, I've set up affinity, but I'm also ensuring that then be can't be broken provides

41
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:59,215
a lot of confidence if anyone were to try and come and audit you on that.

42
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:03,215
So how will you know that it's not going to be implied? Well I have affinity.

43
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:08,215
My score is just configured in a certain way so that it doesn't crossover and I'm using DSC to ensure that

44
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:15,215
if anyone accidently makes a change to that affinity, it autocorrects so that we don't get into a situation

45
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,215
where we're no longer compliant.

46
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:25,215
I agree, but on the other hand, I would be more inclined like we heard that to do this with rules and DRS

47
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,215
will also discover that its numbers were sitting on the right machine.

48
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:37,215
Perhaps the DRS cycle is not as frequent as the LCM agent cycle, but I consider this more on management of

49
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:43,215
your vSphere environment. LCM is another layer, another level. Getting those rules in the cluster, that I would

50
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:49,215
leave to DSC LCM. But applying the rule, I would leave that to vSphere in this case.

51
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:55,215
But you're right, you could envision doing it that way as well, but then you would be recreating the same

52
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:58,215
functionality that is already there in vSphere.

53
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:09,215
I'm simply implying that those affinity rules be set and managed so that they can't be staying with DSC.

54
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,215
Yep.

55
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:17,215
So vSphere is still doing its thing, it's still responsible for ensuring and guaranteeing that the workload

56
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:24,215
doesn't move, it's just that you're simply saying that DSC is keeping an eye on DRS affinity to make sure

57
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:30,215
that those rules don't change because someone could change one of those rules in DRS and virtual center server,

58
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:36,215
which could cause a problem that would make you noncompliant, but if DSC is just keeping an eye on that,

59
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:41,215
then that's less likely to happen. But yet you still let DRS do its thing, not have LCM do it.

60
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:46,215
Yeah. Fully agree with that one. Yeah, good idea. Anymore questions?

61
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,215
Yeah.

62
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:52,215
Do you need a vEngine forâ€¦?

63
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:58,215
No. No, that's the reason why, okay, I'm not going to pull it up again, you remember.

64
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:07,215
With the vEngine, you can use multiple sessions in there. So each session could be connecting to another

65
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:15,215
vSphere server be it multiple vCenters, be it multiple ESXi nodes or a mix of those two, no.

66
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:23,215
Because in the resource, I'm going to pull it up in any case because this is quite important.

67
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:33,215
That was on session one, but I can pull it up if I, okay, let me check if I know.

68
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,215
I can't find it immediately, but I can show you after the session that I am doing is in fact in each resource

69
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:47,215
entry in your configuration file, I had two properties, which is a vServer, which is the indication to which

70
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:55,215
vCenter or ESXi you are connecting and vCredential, which is a credential you should use for that connection.

71
00:06:55,215 --> 00:07:01,215
So per resource you can define where it is located, so in the case of multiple ones, you go to the correct

72
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:06,215
one in that case. Does that answer your?

73
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,215
Yes.

74
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:18,215
Thank you. Any more questions? Just what I also mentioned in the first session on Monday, these DSC resources

75
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:25,215
are a work in progress. I have a number of them. When I'm back home, I will start publishing them.

76
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:28,215
They are now in a private repository that I'm using to develop them.

77
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:35,215
I will put them on public GitHub because this thing, its environment is so complex no one person will be able

78
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:43,215
to do all that stuff, so I'm counting a bit on community contribution there in the coming months.

79
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:51,215
I don't know what. Also, on the priorities because like I said this stuff is quite complex, I could imagine

80
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:59,215
that I would now if I put priorities on my to-do list so that I would first be looking at distributed switches part.

81
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:09,215
Perhaps the majority of the users say I would rather first see a fully working cluster resource, so it's in

82
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:17,215
fact up to you guys to tell me or do the work yourself or tell me which one should be the next on my list.

83
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:23,215
Yeah, we already reached that one of course since we are discussing your questions.

84
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:33,215
No. Anymore? Okay, then I thank you for attending this code heavy session.

85
00:08:33,215 --> 00:59:59,999
I hope I didn't bother you. Thanks!
