00:00:14,14 --> 00:00:15,5
Good morning.

2
00:00:15,5 --> 00:00:22,22
We're going to do a second session on DSC in a vSphere environment.

3
00:00:22,22 --> 00:00:30,30
I'm not sure if some of you saw the session on Monday where I gave the high level view on what we're doing

4
00:00:30,30 --> 00:00:32,32
with converting,

5
00:00:32,32 --> 00:00:38,38
configuring your vSphere environment to a DSC-based configuration-based environment.

6
00:00:38,38 --> 00:00:47,47
First of all, this slide we can't show it enough. These guys did tremendous work in the last couple of 10 years

7
00:00:47,47 --> 00:00:54,54
and more even. Without them, this thing wouldn't be happening and what I'm going to talk about wouldn't be

8
00:00:54,54 --> 00:01:01,61
happening, so thank you to all of those on the list. Much appreciated.

9
00:01:01,61 --> 00:01:08,68
What are we going to talk about, while the one on Monday was kind of high-level overview where we looked at

10
00:01:08,68 --> 00:01:16,76
the concepts that I'm trying to following to convert your vSphere configuration to a DSC-based one, I'm now going

11
00:01:16,76 --> 00:01:21,81
to dive into some code. So for those of you who don't want to see a lot of lines of codes, you still have

12
00:01:21,81 --> 00:01:28,88
time to leave if you want or get an extra coffee. I don't know what you prefer, but there will be some code

13
00:01:28,88 --> 00:01:30,90
involved this time.

14
00:01:30,90 --> 00:01:38,98
I will show you one of the things I'm looking at and developing. It's in a far, it's in a stage that it's

15
00:01:38,98 --> 00:01:46,106
usable, but it's open for a lot of expansions as we will show later on.

16
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:53,113
We'll handle some points more in detail like we mentioned on Monday.

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:59,119
In your vSphere hierarchy, there is a tree structure with all kinds of different nodes in there.

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,126
You have folders, data centers, clusters, and so on, so determining where your new resource will be created

19
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,131
or defined is quite important that's why the location, location, location thing is in there.

20
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:19,139
So we need to make sure that we position ourselves on the right note and that inventory tree the moment we

21
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:26,146
try to create a new resource. There's a small example of reusing code like we always do.

22
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,148
I do at least.

23
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:36,156
I think it was during the last VM World that we made this famous claim, don't write the code, just steal it

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:44,164
if it's already out there. There's a lot of valuable blogs out there, tons of code, so don't reinvent the wheel.

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:50,170
But one thing you should keep in mind, if you copy something from the internet or even your best friend, test it.

26
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:57,177
Don't run it like that in production. We never do that, of course, but just as a warning on the side make

27
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,181
sure that you test what you copy from others.

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,185
And automation, as it should be case with everything we do in PowerShell is

29
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:10,190
our ultimate goal. Who am I? Okay, I'll keep this short since I already had in a previous one.

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:16,196
I'm Luc Dekens. I do a bit of talking at VM World in the last years.

31
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:28,208
We have a book. Second edition just came out. I will plug my book only once in contrast to some other people, right.

32
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:35,215
And if you want to reach me, there's a Twitter handle that you can use to contact me and there's a mail link

33
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:43,223
on my blog if you need more detailed questions than 140 characters in a question.

34
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:50,230
Okay, a quick overview for those who didn't attend a session or already forgot.

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,235
It has been two days of brain melt, at least it has been for me.

36
00:03:55,235 --> 00:04:03,243
DSC is a very valuable resource array of configuring your environment.

37
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:11,251
Now unfortunately at the moment, VMware themselves, they don't provide any resources for that, but since we

38
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:16,256
have the option, we had the option in the past and we still have it to script DSC resources.

39
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:25,265
Now with WMF5, we have the option to do those class-based resources with even better, more optimal.

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm trying to start something going where we have resources defined for your complete vSphere environment.

41
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:40,280
So like I showed last Monday, we already have quite a few, but it's still a lot need to be done,

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,286
especially in the finer details of the configurations. Another thing, an important thing, that we want to

43
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:53,293
obtain with the converting to DSC is that we want this famous separation of where and what.

44
00:04:53,293 --> 00:05:02,302
I just made a small two screenshots at the bottom there. So if you look at that one, the right one, is the one

45
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:08,308
where we will actually do something. That is your actual folder name that you're going to create and the location

46
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:13,313
where you want to create that folder name. This is the part that you want to put under source control.

47
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:18,318
This is where the changes will be visible where you can make the drift with the previous situation.

48
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:23,323
On the left, that's the what you will be doing. That's only a small extract.

49
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:32,332
That is the one that creates a folder and it uses the data that we specified in the right side text that you

50
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:39,339
see there, which is part of your configuration file. So this is the important concepts in what we are trying

51
00:05:39,339 --> 00:59:59,999
to do with DSC for a vSphere.
