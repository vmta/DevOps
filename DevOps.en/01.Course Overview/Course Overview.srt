00:00:05,5 --> 00:00:07,7
Hi everyone, my name is Don Jones,

2
00:00:07,7 --> 00:00:08,8
and I'd like to introduce you

3
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:12,12
to PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2016.

4
00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:14,14
Summit is a unique annual event

5
00:00:14,14 --> 00:00:16,16
for the global PowerShell and DevOps community

6
00:00:16,16 --> 00:00:19,19
and for 2016 we were fortunate to have Pluralsight

7
00:00:19,19 --> 00:00:24,24
help us capture some of the amazing presentations.

8
00:00:24,24 --> 00:00:26,26
You'll find more than 30 breakout sessions

9
00:00:26,26 --> 00:00:28,28
and general presentations

10
00:00:28,28 --> 00:00:31,31
representing some of the best to what summit has to offer,

11
00:00:31,31 --> 00:00:33,33
you will hear from PowerShell MVP's,

12
00:00:33,33 --> 00:00:35,35
product team members and community enthusiasts

13
00:00:35,35 --> 00:00:39,39
and more importantly, you'll explore incredibly deep topics

14
00:00:39,39 --> 00:00:44,44
that simply don't exist anywhere else.

15
00:00:44,44 --> 00:00:45,45
Want to peak under the hood

16
00:00:45,45 --> 00:00:48,48
of how Desired State Configuration works?

17
00:00:48,48 --> 00:00:49,49
Want to learn about advanced

18
00:00:49,49 --> 00:00:52,52
debugging techniques in PowerShell 5?

19
00:00:52,52 --> 00:00:54,54
Want to learn what DevOps really looks like

20
00:00:54,54 --> 00:00:56,56
in a real organization?

21
00:00:56,56 --> 00:00:58,58
Want to see the latest about

22
00:00:58,58 --> 00:01:01,61
domain-specific languages in PowerShell?

23
00:01:01,61 --> 00:01:02,62
All of those and more were covered

24
00:01:02,62 --> 00:01:05,65
at PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2016

25
00:01:05,65 --> 00:01:07,67
and thanks to Pluralsight,

26
00:01:07,67 --> 00:59:59,999
you can watch them at your leisure.
