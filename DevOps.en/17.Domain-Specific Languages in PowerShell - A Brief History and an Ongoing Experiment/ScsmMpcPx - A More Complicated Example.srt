00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,487
So one of the things I do, I work for Provance Technologies.

2
00:00:04,487 --> 00:00:11,487
Provance Technologies does IT asset management and now we do full IT system management, and so within that work,

3
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:18,487
we've done a lot of work with System Center and we've plugged into Service Manager and we have this whole

4
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:23,487
solution of asset management inside of Service Manager and one of the things that we wanted to do was to add

5
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:27,487
auto close functionality, which is a really straightforward feature that's just missing in a service manager,

6
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:34,487
but I didn't want to just create a management pack the normal way because creating management packs involves

7
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:39,487
XAML and XAML and compiling workflows and building DLLs and a whole lot of steps that are just really complicated.

8
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:42,487
I wanted to make it so that somebody could create a management pack more easily,

9
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:51,487
so I built this DSL using my DSL, my LanguagePx module called ManagementPackConfiguration and so it defines

10
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:56,487
a management pack and then it sets some attributes on that management pack and then build options,

11
00:00:56,487 --> 00:01:01,487
admin settings, which creates a UI, and so this is quite extensive and you can look at it as an example.

12
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:06,487
I'm not going to run it on my system because I have nothing related to Server Manager on this system right now,

13
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:11,487
but I wanted to include it as an example showing how big you can get, right, I mean I showed you a small

14
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:16,487
example and this is a much larger example of a DSL and the kind of things you can do with it, but it's pretty

15
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:22,487
powerful and pretty cool and it's great fun to watch this happen because I see DLLs being compiled

16
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:26,487
and built, and placed in the right structure, and then putting it into a management pack, and then into a

17
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:31,487
management pack bundle, and code siding, and so many steps, again, but done in a simpler way, right.

18
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:35,487
So it's about peeling back the onion and getting down to

19
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:43,487
just defining the content. So on the resources slide, that last piece that I mentioned is from ScsmMpcPx,

20
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:47,487
so if you go into GitHub, that's where you can take a look at that larger example.

21
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:52,487
LanguagePx is on GitHub, that's the main module I was talking about, and of course, ImportExcel you can grab

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,487
from the PowerShell gallery.

23
00:01:55,487 --> 00:02:00,487
And if you want to contact me for anything, there's my contact information, which I already mentioned at the beginning.

24
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:05,487
So thanks and if you do see these people while you're here at this event, tip your hat to them because these

25
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:10,487
guys have been on PowerShell for a heck of a long time. It's a great product, a great foundation, so give them

26
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:12,487
credit for their work because it's fantastic.

27
00:02:12,487 --> 00:59:59,999
And that's it. Thank you.
