00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,67
So back in the day before the recycle bin, you delete an object,

2
00:00:05,67 --> 00:00:07,67
it gets tombstoned, and then there

3
00:00:07,67 --> 00:00:13,67
was Mark Savage's tool that you could put the object back and it looks really beat up when it comes back,

4
00:00:13,67 --> 00:00:19,67
but it's just got the SID enough to really preserve the identity, so you don't have to go reset all the permissions,

5
00:00:19,67 --> 00:00:23,67
but it loses everything else essentially. Now we've got the recycle bin.

6
00:00:23,67 --> 00:00:31,67
We don't have that concern because now we have the recycle bin. Depending on what interval of your tombstone

7
00:00:31,67 --> 00:00:37,67
lifetime was set when you implemented it determines how many, usually it's modern system it's 180 days,

8
00:00:37,67 --> 00:00:43,67
you've got the recycle bin, then after that, you've got a tombstone for another 180 days, so potentially a year

9
00:00:43,67 --> 00:00:46,67
theoretically to get an object back.

10
00:00:46,67 --> 00:00:52,67
So the problem is when you query in Active Directory in the deleted objects container, so if I look at the

11
00:00:52,67 --> 00:01:01,67
Get-ADDomain, there's a property on Get-ADDomain that tells me where the deleted objects container is.

12
00:01:01,67 --> 00:01:08,67
I find that exact property here. Deleted objects here and CohoVineyard is my sample domain today.

13
00:01:08,67 --> 00:01:15,67
So I'm going to pick that deleted objects container. So the other thing I was thinking was hey what if the

14
00:01:15,67 --> 00:01:22,67
hackers deleted some accounts or deleted some data in Active Directory that I want to go inspect.

15
00:01:22,67 --> 00:01:28,67
So let's take a look. I'm going to look at that deleted objects container here and I'm going to set that as

16
00:01:28,67 --> 00:01:33,67
the search base for my query. That's where I'm going to start my query, but when you're querying deleted objects,

17
00:01:33,67 --> 00:01:40,67
you have to include this parameter IncludeDeletedObjects because normally those are hidden by default.

18
00:01:40,67 --> 00:01:46,67
So I'm going to view those deleted objects and grab those under a variable called DeletedObjects and then I'm

19
00:01:46,67 --> 00:01:55,67
going to sort them by modified, but the problem I had here and let's see, there we go, and so you get the Dell

20
00:01:55,67 --> 00:02:05,67
thing in the name and all that. There's a last known parent attribute as well in here that gets populated

21
00:02:05,67 --> 00:02:11,67
when they're deleted. The problem is that basically there are some date fields in here, but there's no good

22
00:02:11,67 --> 00:02:20,67
date field to tell me when it was deleted, when or where that delete originated.

23
00:02:20,67 --> 00:02:27,67
So what I want to do then is look at the metadata just like we've looked at everything else, now I can see

24
00:02:27,67 --> 00:02:33,67
which domain controller initiated that delete putting it in the recycle bin and then go look at the logs on

25
00:02:33,67 --> 00:02:39,67
that DC for that time period to see who was making the change.

26
00:02:39,67 --> 00:02:46,67
Alright, so that's the way we track it back. We use the replication metadata to find which DC originated

27
00:02:46,67 --> 00:02:51,67
change, then we go look at the security log on that DC to see where it was.

28
00:02:51,67 --> 00:02:57,67
Now most likely these security logs are rolling pretty frequently, so you would have to have some type of event

29
00:02:57,67 --> 00:03:03,67
log collection forwarding something going on in your environment to be able to search those historically.

30
00:03:03,67 --> 00:03:17,67
So what I could do here would be to run through and let's take a look at with the metadata here, put that in the GridView.

31
00:03:17,67 --> 00:03:23,67
And so now I've got deleted objects, whenCreated, and whenDeleted right here.

32
00:03:23,67 --> 00:03:29,67
Alright, so that shows me when the object was deleted and what that's pulling back is it's a calculated value

33
00:03:29,67 --> 00:03:37,67
based on that metadata for the change date on the object. It says this is the last change was putting it in

34
00:03:37,67 --> 00:03:44,67
the recycle bin, so I know that's the date it was deleted. And so I can now see a dated list of what things

35
00:03:44,67 --> 00:03:51,67
were deleted in descending order from today and then go look at the event window, those date ranges that are

36
00:03:51,67 --> 00:03:58,67
suspect and see were there things that were wholesale deleted by the hackers in that window.

37
00:03:58,67 --> 00:04:12,67
Anecdotally, while I was surfing through this company's directory data, I found an actual account with the name Hacker.

38
00:04:12,67 --> 00:59:59,999
It turns out there's a user in Europe with the last name of Hacker.  So they were legit.
