1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:18,5
I want to tell you a story. So I go help customers. That's what I do.

2
00:00:18,5 --> 00:00:23,5
Some people call premier field engineers, they're like ninjas jumping out of helicopters.

3
00:00:23,5 --> 00:00:29,5
So it was a Friday evening and I should speak to the microphone over here.

4
00:00:29,5 --> 00:00:38,5
So it was a Friday evening and I had just logged off for the day, getting ready to have dinner with the family

5
00:00:38,5 --> 00:00:44,5
and I'd worked it out where I had two weeks at home to do some remote project work so I didn't have to be on the road.

6
00:00:44,5 --> 00:00:50,5
I was really looking forward to the next two weeks. Friday evening, I sit back in my recliner, I've got my

7
00:00:50,5 --> 00:01:02,5
comfy clothes on and my phone rings. We have somebody called the on-duty critsit manager, and a critsit is

8
00:01:02,5 --> 00:01:11,5
kind of like you guys are on call for your company, right, but we're on call for every company in the world.

9
00:01:11,5 --> 00:01:18,5
Alright, and I don't get those calls very often, but I got the call and the manager says we need you.

10
00:01:18,5 --> 00:01:25,5
Have you seen the news? I said no I haven't looked at the news.

11
00:01:25,5 --> 00:01:33,5
He said turn on your TV or look at the internet, whatever. And so I look at the news and I oh no.

12
00:01:33,5 --> 00:01:41,5
So I, he says we need you, this was Friday evening, he said we need you on site Monday morning with the customer.

13
00:01:41,5 --> 00:01:45,5
Now this customer will be unnamed. I'm not going to tell you what industry, what geography, anything about this

14
00:01:45,5 --> 00:01:55,5
customer, alright, because we do this on a regular basis. So I get to the customer site, I show up to the

15
00:01:55,5 --> 00:02:00,5
standard security check-in where they give you your badge and all that with the security people, right.

16
00:02:00,5 --> 00:02:06,5
They don't have any computer. Their computers are turned off. They're handwriting nametags and writing them

17
00:02:06,5 --> 00:02:12,5
on a clipboard. This is the security check-in at the front desk at the company.

18
00:02:12,5 --> 00:02:18,5
I get off the elevator and there's a sign posted for all the employees that says do not turn on your computer

19
00:02:18,5 --> 00:02:28,5
until further notice. And that week, the FBI was at the company briefing employees on identity theft

20
00:02:28,5 --> 00:02:36,5
protection and how to guard themselves online. It was post-apocalyptic.

21
00:02:36,5 --> 00:02:48,5
This IT environment was pretty much cratered by hackers and they call me to come in and say we need you to

22
00:02:48,5 --> 00:02:53,5
look at the Active Directory and tell us if it's okay to bring back online.

23
00:02:53,5 --> 00:03:00,5
When we realized that we were breached, we started shutting down domain controllers and we had two that were

24
00:03:00,5 --> 00:03:08,5
offshore in other countries where we've got the VM captured and we've taken the time of a couple days to

25
00:03:08,5 --> 00:03:13,5
transmit that VM over our high speed lines to get it in an isolated lab.

26
00:03:13,5 --> 00:03:20,5
We want you to look at this DC and tell us if you can find any fingerprints of the hackers in the Active Directory

27
00:03:20,5 --> 00:03:27,5
data so we know whether it's okay to reuse this domain environment because otherwise, we're building completely

28
00:03:27,5 --> 00:03:35,5
from green field the entire company. That's kind of a big deal.

29
00:03:35,5 --> 00:03:37,5
I wasn't ready for that.

30
00:03:37,5 --> 00:03:41,5
So Active Directory Forensics. Here's our problem.

31
00:03:41,5 --> 00:03:51,5
How do you track malicious activity in your domain environment when you didn't have the auditing turned on?

32
00:03:51,5 --> 00:03:57,5
How many of you have auditing properly enabled in your Active Directory environment?

33
00:03:57,5 --> 00:04:06,5
Right, properly, right. Alright, about two-thirds of you, so that's about, yeah, that's actually better than average.

34
00:04:06,5 --> 00:04:16,5
So what our problem to solve is how do you find the footprints of what we call an actor in your environment

35
00:04:16,5 --> 00:04:23,5
if they're tampering with your Active Directory data and you did not properly have auditing turned on.

36
00:04:23,5 --> 00:04:25,5
It's a big deal.

37
00:04:25,5 --> 00:04:31,5
What we're going to do is we're going to dive into just the single DC lab here and look at some things

38
00:04:31,5 --> 00:04:38,5
and teach you some concepts, some ways that you can work with your Active Directory data and try to find some

39
00:04:38,5 --> 00:04:43,5
of these things. So what we're going to imagine is that you create an account, you create a group,

40
00:04:43,5 --> 00:04:49,5
you put the user in the group, you nest that group in domain admin somewhere to try to hide that it's not

41
00:04:49,5 --> 00:04:56,5
an immediate member of domain admins, you grant that account control of an OU, then you delete the account,

42
00:04:56,5 --> 00:05:01,5
delete the group, kind of what we would assume to be hacker activity is now.

43
00:05:01,5 --> 00:05:10,5
The truth is, with targeted malware aimed at companies sponsored by nation states, they usually don't even

44
00:05:10,5 --> 00:05:14,5
need to create accounts because they're going to find somebody on the network that's stored their password in

45
00:05:14,5 --> 00:05:21,5
clear text and they'll just use their accounts. So sometimes we may not, and that was part of the case at

46
00:05:21,5 --> 00:05:28,5
this one particular customer. The hackers didn't really need to create any extra accounts because they had

47
00:05:28,5 --> 00:05:33,5
already found all the passwords in a spreadsheet in the network.

48
00:05:33,5 --> 00:05:38,5
I know you guys don't do that though, that's okay. Alright. Don't be that company.

49
00:05:38,5 --> 00:59:59,999
Don't be that company, alright.
