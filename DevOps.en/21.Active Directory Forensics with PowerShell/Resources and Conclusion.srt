00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:15,838
So let me wrap here. So where can I find these scripts? Go out to aka.ms/ADForensics and that is a link to

2
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:23,838
the blog feed that has all of my posts that are tagged with forensics-related topics.

3
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:31,838
So you can go check all of those aka.ms/ADForensics. Also, in my Microsoft Virtual Academy Video series,

4
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:37,838
I have eight video segments on MVA about doing Active Directory with PowerShell.

5
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:43,838
The fourth segment in that is all about forensics where I talk about some of these same topics, but I don't,

6
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:47,838
I didn't go into the same level of detail that I did today, but it's all there for you,

7
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:55,838
the ReplicationAttributeMetadata and things like that. Also, Microsoft is doing a lot in the area of cyber security.

8
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:03,838
I've been on a few of these covert dispatches myself where

9
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:11,838
they don't even tell me the name of the customer. I showed up, they said here's the address, I'll meet you there.

10
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:17,838
It was like I was volunteering to be abducted or something and I'm going to go in this secret door and it's a

11
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:23,838
need---it's like cloak and dagger stuff. They don't even---in our systems we don't even track the name of the customer.

12
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:30,838
We use a fake name all this because it's very confidential when we're dealing with cyber security investigations.

13
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:37,838
So we have a full team of PFEs and MCS consultants that specialize in cyber engagements.

14
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:49,838
If you're company has been hacked, if you get that call, if you become aware of it, please call us because

15
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:54,838
some of the kneejerk reactions that you take as soon as you find out you've been hacked, the things that you

16
00:01:54,838 --> 00:02:02,838
think are the best thing to do, are not. And we have trained experts that will help you investigate and

17
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:11,838
remediate your situation, so please contact us. We also, there are a lot of vendors in this space and I'm

18
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:19,838
not trying to just say that we're the best, right, but we are because we have special tools in the world that

19
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:26,838
nobody else has because we're Microsoft. We have lots of special data that they simply don't have.

20
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:27,838
Please call us

21
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:33,838
if you have a cyber incident. Satya Nadella at the end of last year did a special press conference with some

22
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:41,838
people in DC about cyber security. The things that are really hard to track is when you're looking at millions

23
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:49,838
of event log entries across domain controllers for the last year, how do I know what's normal activity and

24
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:59,838
what's malicious activity. We're using machine learning to study event logs and identify abnormal activity

25
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:02,838
in your environment. So we're doing a lot of research in this space.

26
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:06,838
We have a lot of experts to help you with your cyber security needs.

27
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:12,838
And so I mentioned at the beginning that you really need to make sure that you have your auditing set up correctly.

28
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:20,838
Here are some blog links particularly to the Ask PFE Platforms blog that have some expert advice from some of

29
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:25,838
my peers on how to properly audit your Active Directory environment so that you don't have to worry about

30
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:30,838
these other methods to try to find the data when it's too late.

31
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:38,838
So, closing then. Don't be that company. Don't put clear text passwords in a spreadsheet.

32
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:47,838
It happens. These companies end up in the news. Audit your Active Directory environment the right way.

33
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:53,838
Set up alerts. Take the sample code, even if, most people are always complaining about IT budgets,

34
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:59,838
this is PowerShell. Do it for free, use these scripts, and set up alerts in your environment.

35
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:04,838
Learn this ReplicationAttributeMetadata cmdlet. It's going to be your best friend.

36
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:10,838
Cyber security is a huge topic. This is just a very small part. There's so much more we can do with cyber

37
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:15,838
forensics in Active Directory. This is just to get you started there.

38
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,838
So check out the new machine learning stuff I mentioned from Microsoft.

39
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:24,838
And if your company gets hacked, please call us. And I don't say that to put other vendors in a bad light.

40
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:31,838
It's just that we have experts that this is all they do and they live on site with customers for months

41
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:37,838
helping them recover from these terrible scenarios. And finally, if this has helped you, please send me a tweet

42
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:42,838
just so my boss knows that I'm actually not golfing, but I'm helping people in the real world.

43
00:04:42,838 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you. Alright.
