1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,884
So let's talk about ISE preview priorities if I can get back to where my presentation was.

2
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:13,884
There we are. So one of the first things I want to do as you may have seen is

3
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:20,884
address as much high value UserVoice feedback as I can. I've started this work, but there's still a lot more

4
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,884
work to be done. I mean there's a lot of

5
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:28,884
issues that have been voted up on UserVoice and some of them are definitely possible, others not as possible.

6
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:33,884
I mean there's probably not going to be the likelihood that we're going to change sort of the UI model of the

7
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:38,884
ISE where you can sort of have Docking tabs and stuff just because it's a lot of extra work.

8
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:48,884
I think that ISE Steroids may solve that problem already. But just anything we can do that will be a general

9
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:53,884
productivity improvement or something that the ISE is lacking that other editors just sort of have by default,

10
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:59,884
definitely file feedback for that. What about little things like maybe let's say like where you draw your

11
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,884
bracket or whatever and you can't enter it. You know what I mean?

12
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:06,884
It goes like double does the line indents for you. Is it going to be like that stuff?

13
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:12,884
We can definitely look into it. I don't really know how much effort it would take, but definitely worth looking into.

14
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:18,884
So I don't know if there's already a UserVoice item for that, but if someone files it, we'll definitely look into it.

15
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:25,884
(Audience comment) Yeah, definitely that. (Audience comment) Yeah, pretty much every editor has the sort

16
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:30,884
of automatic indentation functionality, so this is something that is a little annoying whenever you go into

17
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:37,884
the ISE and it just doesn't have things like this. So basically, my plan is to work on the highest value

18
00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:44,884
improvements that will address long-term pain points and the goal really isn't to make the ISE at the same

19
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:48,884
level as other editors that exist because you can just use the other editors instead, but it's just we want

20
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:55,884
to make this like really solid core editor with a really good extensibility so that the community can come

21
00:01:55,884 --> 00:02:01,884
and add more features as necessary. So also, for new

22
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:07,884
feature development in the ISE preview and the full ISE, I'd like to focus on what we can add through the

23
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:11,884
ISE's add-on model to enable new features

24
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:18,884
to be added using our add-on APIs rather than being added into the ISE code base.

25
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:24,884
This may involve just some tadpole improvements here and there to our existing extensibility points,

26
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:31,884
but the goal would be just sort of enable new things that people can do to extend the life of the ISE by

27
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:36,884
adding new functionality. This is in the area that I'd really appreciate getting some feedback on UserVoice

28
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:42,884
about what new extensibility points would be helpful. I'm looking for a high value, low cost improvements

29
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:48,884
that will enable new types of extensibility in the ISE. There's also a new extensibility model that's coming,

30
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:54,884
which is complimentary to the ISE's add-on model, but I'll discuss that a little bit later.

31
00:02:54,884 --> 00:03:00,884
So the biggest priority for the ISE is a gradual overhaul that brings in PowerShell Editor Services as their

32
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:04,884
core implementation for all this editor features.

33
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,884
This integration will be rolled out over time in a way that should minimize disruption to existing scenarios

34
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:13,884
while allowing everyone to try out the new features and provide feedback.

35
00:03:13,884 --> 00:03:20,884
So generally speaking, what this means is that ISE, sorry, PowerShell Editor Services will basically provide

36
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:28,884
the host environment for PowerShell so that all the things like IntelliSense and code navigations, etc,

37
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:33,884
will be coming from there, rather than from the existing code base in the ISE and this will help in some ways

38
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:38,884
because currently we've got some sort of problems with the ISE code base where you might see things like

39
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:46,884
when it crashes or hangs and stuff like that really shouldn't be happening and it's due to sort of a bad

40
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:51,884
throating design, etc, but we can get away from a lot of those problems by shifting to a different core and

41
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:57,884
sort of refactoring the code that's already there. So as I mentioned earlier, the ISE preview release

42
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:04,884
contains an experimental PowerShell tab, which will be the basis for this conversion and this new tab we use

43
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:11,884
editor services to basically provide all these features. And since editor services currently doesn't support

44
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:16,884
as many features as the PowerShell ISE does, we'll have to continue to improve that support over time before

45
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:21,884
we actually make the Experimental tab the default. So remote session is just one thing.

46
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:25,884
We don't really support remote sessions yet. There may be some other little things here and there that I

47
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:30,884
haven't thought about, so we'll have to figure those things out sort of as the migration happens.

48
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:39,884
But once we make the Experimental tab actually the default tab, then we'll keep the old tab, the legacy tab

49
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:44,884
around just to have it there in case anyone hits an edge case in the behavior of the new implementation

50
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:53,884
so that it can use the old style tab for whatever it is they need to do.

51
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:54,884
And ultimately,

52
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:59,884
these improvements should be integrated back into the build of the ISE that we ship with Windows, but we still

53
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,884
haven't decided when and how we want to

54
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,884
accomplish this since shipping in box of Windows requires some extra work around quality, localization,

55
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:13,884
and other types of work. But the current plan is to try integrating new stable features from the preview

56
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:19,884
back into the built-in ISE sometime after the next Windows Server and client versions have been released,

57
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:25,884
so probably later this year sometime, way later this year. We want to make sure that whatever we end up

58
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:30,884
shipping is of high quality and has been put through as paces by the community just to make sure that it's

59
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:34,884
not going to be a problem when it's actually in box and it needs to be shipped, I mean sorry, it needs to be

60
00:05:34,884 --> 00:59:59,999
supported for years and years.
