00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:10,449
So lastly,  I want to mention that we need volunteers for a usability study tomorrow at 4:30 PM, so this is right after

2
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:17,449
the lightning demo session. We need about 20 to 30 people to participate in a UI study for a possible new

3
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:22,449
feature for Windows Server. It's like a prototype that I've been working on.

4
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:28,449
We are looking mainly for beginner to intermediate people with PowerShell, but advanced users are welcome.

5
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:33,449
It doesn't if you're MVP or not. If you're not an MVP, well you can sign an NDA there.

6
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:38,449
If you're interested in joining, please talk to me or Mark Gray, who's a PM on the PowerShell team, to sign up

7
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:44,449
and we'll let you know more details tomorrow about what room it'll be in, that sort of thing.

8
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:49,449
So thank you very much for coming to my talk. Here is some details about myself on Twitter and GitHub and

9
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,449
also the link to

10
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:56,449
PowerShell Editor Services on GitHub as well. I think we have a little bit of time for questions if anybody

11
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:12,449
wants to ask questions. All good. (Audience question) It comes bundled with the VS code extension.

12
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:18,449
So whenever you installed the extension through VS code's extension installer, it has everything you need there.

13
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:25,449
So yeah. So basically, it's a dynamic application that is bundled and it just gets launched with the extension.

14
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:30,449
When did the interactive shell get derived? Last time I checked code out, it wasn't.

15
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:36,449
Yeah, so it's been there for maybe two or three releases. It's sort of hidden because you can't actually

16
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:41,449
type directly in it. It's actually an output pane where if you select some code and hit F8, it will run it

17
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:49,449
and show the output, (Audience comment) yeah, so the sort of hacky way to deal with that for now is to

18
00:01:49,449 --> 00:02:00,449
just type something not Format-Volume obviously, but like Get-Process, and hit F8, and it will give you the output, but.

19
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:04,449
Will F8 just select the current line by default? F8 runs whatever you currently have selected.

20
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:10,449
I think somebody added the function where, this is not actually selected, it's just highlighted.

21
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,449
I think if you don't have a selection, it runs the current line.

22
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:18,449
Yeah, okay. I don't know why it failed at that point. (Audience comment)

23
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,449
Yeah, it runs up to where the cursor is. That's a little weird, but anyway.

24
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:31,449
Yeah so what we're waiting on is for VS code to add the console so that we can basically just wire this directly

25
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:34,449
into a console where you can type in commands, so that's coming.

26
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:37,449
I think that within the next couple of months it'll be there. Yeah, that would definitely change my whole

27
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:43,449
view on it. Yeah, that's like the one thing that's missing, I think, until this like way better.

28
00:02:43,449 --> 00:59:59,999
But anyway, I think we're out of time, so thank you very much for coming.
