00:00:01,1 --> 00:00:03,989
So since this presentation is supposed to be about the future of PowerShell ISE,

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:07,989
let's talk about the ISE preview. We made an announcement a couple months ago that we

3
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:13,989
had shipped an alternative version of the ISE via the PowerShell gallery, which gives us the opportunity to

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:19,989
try out some new features and new ideas while keeping the built-in ISE stable.

5
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:24,989
Our intention is to ship updates with new features somewhere between a monthly and a bi-monthly cadence.

6
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,989
Having said that, you may have notice that it's been a little while since the first release.

7
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:33,989
I think that we released it in February and it's still lacking another release since then, but that's for a

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,989
good reason though. I've actually been working over the last few weeks to put together a new release that

9
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,989
addresses some of the most highly uploaded feedback on UserVoice and also a new feature that I think all of

10
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,989
you are going to like. So instead of just showing you a list of what these new features would be,

11
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,989
why don't I just give you a quick demo to kind of show it that way.

12
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:01,989
Let's see if I can pull that up. Alright,

13
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,989
so one of the first things you may notice that's a little bit different is that there's this little icon here

14
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:15,989
in the lower left-hand corner. So now we have the ability when the ISE preview starts up to do a scan for

15
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,989
any PowerShell gallery modules that you may have installed and to check if there's any updates for those

16
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:26,989
because currently there's not a really good way to see which gallery modules you have that may have updates

17
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:31,989
that you haven't installed yet, so I decided to put a little piece of UI here that will give you the

18
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:37,989
information for this. Alright, so when I click the icon, there's a new window that appears that gives me a

19
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:44,989
list of the modules that currently have updates and we can see here that the Pscx module needs to be updated.

20
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:49,989
Of course, this was released in 2015 so it's sort of contrive example.

21
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:53,989
Also, there's PSScriptAnalyzer, which has been updated to version 1.5.

22
00:01:53,989 --> 00:02:00,989
So you can see that we're actually gathering the release notes and the version information from the gallery information.

23
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,989
You can see that sort of all the details are here. Also, you can select whether you want all updates or just

24
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:13,989
uncheck various updates that you're not interested in. And another interesting thing here is that the Pscx

25
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,989
module actually was installed system wide. It wasn't installed for just a current user.

26
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,989
So I'm not actually running the ISE preview elevator right now, so it's sort of interesting to see what

27
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:29,989
happens whenever we do this. So I'm going to go ahead and just click Update to update these modules.

28
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:35,989
So since Pscx needs admin level credentials, we actually see an error that sort of shows you.

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,989
It's basically just an error that comes directly from PowerShell from the cmdlet.

30
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:45,989
And also, you'll see that there's a prompt for the untrusted repository, but I think that should change soon.

31
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:51,989
But now since it's all in PSScriptAnalyzer and if I had other modules that needed to be updated, they would all

32
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,989
be installed as well, so pretty easy. Just install like all your updated modules.

33
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,989
It's nice for people who actually are module developers so that whenever you push a new version of your module,

34
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,989
people who are using the ISE will actually be able to install it, they'll know that it exists.

35
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:15,989
So since this functionality starts automatically with ISE, some people may not want to have like the initial

36
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,989
performance hit of having this sort of module scan and update scan happening, so we've actually

37
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:27,989
added a new option in the Options dialog, in the General Settings tab, so you can actually uncheck the Check

38
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,989
for module updates automatically option. So that will stop it from happening at start up.

39
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,989
And if you ever want to invoke the process, you can go to the Help menu and click Check for updates so that

40
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,989
will kick off the update process. So that's sort of the big new feature.

41
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,989
There's another thing that we're doing that sort of sets the stage

42
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,989
for future work on the PowerShell Editor Services integration and that is the

43
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:57,989
new experimental PowerShell tab. So if you click the File menu, you'll see that there is a new item for an

44
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,989
Experimental PowerShell tab, and right now if you open it, there's really nothing different.

45
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,989
It's the same functionality that we currently have, but the point is to have the separate tab so that we can

46
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,989
start to gradually do the integration with PowerShell Editor Services over time and not disrupt the core

47
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,989
PowerShell ISE experience. This also helps people like Tobias Weltner who have ISE Steroids and he sort of

48
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,989
reached into the functionality of the ISE a little too much and if I do anything drastic with the existing

49
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:32,989
PowerShell functionality, it's going to break all the ISE Steroids users, so don't really want to do that.

50
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:38,989
But in the future, you'll be able to try out new features that come from PowerShell Editor Services in this

51
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:44,989
type of tab, so as those things get developed, they'll be talking about it on Twitter probably and let people

52
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:49,989
know that new things are available there.

53
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:56,989
Alright, so there's one UserVoice issue, I think it was filed by Bartech and it was sort of an annoyance for

54
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:01,989
people and a lot of people expressed some interest in getting this removed or getting this changed.

55
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:12,989
Let me see if I can pull up the inbox ISE. So right now, if you were to type something like Get-Process, whoops,

56
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:18,989
and you see there's a lot of output and you want to scroll up in the output pane and sort of see what's going on

57
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:23,989
there then maybe you go into the script editor and mess around a little bit, then you come back and click in the

58
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:31,989
output pane because you want to copy something, but it jumps down to the end, which is a little bit annoying.

59
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:41,989
So now I've removed that behavior. So if we type Get-Process here in ISE preview, you'll see the same output

60
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:48,989
a little bit slower because I'm running it in a debugger. And if I scroll up here and click inside of the

61
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:51,989
script editor and mess around then come back, it doesn't actually jump to the end.

62
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:56,989
So there probably needs to be a little more polish on this to kind of deal with a

63
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,989
couple cases where maybe you do want to jump to the end or maybe if you click in here, you may want to like

64
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:04,989
hit a button and have it jump to the end, so there's a little bit more polishing that needs to be done.

65
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:10,989
But really what I'd like to do is just sort of ship this and see what they've been think and just get some

66
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:17,989
feedback from the community and see what people want it to do. So that's kind of helpful, a little less annoying now.

67
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:25,989
Also just in general, productivity improvements, for instance, when people want to like comment multiple lines

68
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:31,989
of code out, what they've been told in the past is oh just use multiple cursives, and that's not really the

69
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:36,989
ideal way to do this because most editors give you a way to select multiple lines and comment them out,

70
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,989
so I've been working on a feature that allows you to just do that.

71
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:48,989
So if you select a few lines of code and hit Ctrl+K, it just comments all of them out and also Ctrl+Shift+K

72
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:52,989
will uncomment them, but you may notice that the indentations a little bit different now.

73
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:57,989
I need to work on this a little bit, but I think that this is sort of a Windows Core

74
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:03,989
features for an editor that's really necessary that just wasn't there before and I think the reason why it

75
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:07,989
wasn't implemented before is there's little edge cases here and there like detecting whether there are spaces

76
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:12,989
between the comment character, etc. that maybe it just wasn't seen as worth the effort, but I think it's worth

77
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:17,989
the effort, so we're going to try to finish that and get it shipped in the next update.

78
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:25,989
Also, another big problem is if you have a file open in the ISE preview and for whatever reason, the file changes

79
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:29,989
on the file system outside of the ISE, there's no notification. It doesn't tell you that it's been changed,

80
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:35,989
so you might start editing your file here again and save it and then overwrite whatever the external changes were.

81
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:42,989
So now I've tried to get the .NET Framework's file system watcher hooked up to solve this problem, so let's see

82
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:50,989
if it works and doesn't crash and burn. So actually, I'll just go ahead and open this file in Notepad,

83
00:07:50,989 --> 00:08:06,989
the same file in Notepad, and let's see. So I'm going to go and just make a change here in this file and

84
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:13,989
you'll, oh, let me just undo whatever I did here. So this file is unsaved at the moment, sorry, it's saved at

85
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:22,989
the moment, so if I go ahead and just add some text here, save it, then you'll see that it, okay, this time it

86
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:29,989
didn't work, but it crashed. So this was a good time to tell you that

87
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:34,989
.NET's file system watcher is a little unreliable and this crash may be my fault.

88
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:40,989
But the point is that when this first comes out, it's actually probably going to be a little flaky,

89
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:46,989
so we're going to have to do a little work to see what we can do to make it a little bit more reliable.

90
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:52,989
So actually, I'll give it one more shot and see if it works, and if it doesn't, we'll just move on.

91
00:08:52,989 --> 00:09:07,989
(Running) It happened again. Well at least you can't edit it after it…

92
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,989
Yeah, yeah. That's true. Actually, maybe I'll just leave it like this.

93
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:12,989
Yeah, it's a feature, so we'll just

94
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:17,989
restart the session. It's great. We'll just reload the files, no problem.

95
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:22,989
That's right. You guys should all be my marketing team. I'll just let you guys explain all the problems

96
00:09:22,989 --> 00:59:59,999
that we have. That's great. Alright, so let me---
