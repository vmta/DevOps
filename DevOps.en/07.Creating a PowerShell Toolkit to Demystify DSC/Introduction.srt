00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:22,5
Hey, welcome. So welcome to creating a DSC or welcome to creating a PowerShell Toolkit to Demystify DSC.

2
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:26,5
For those of you who don't know me, I'm Mike Robbins. I go by Mike F Robbins online.

3
00:00:26,5 --> 00:00:32,5
I'm a Microsoft MVP on Windows PowerShell, a SAPIEN technologies MVP, leader and co-founder of the PowerShell

4
00:00:32,5 --> 00:00:37,5
user group, the Mississippi PowerShell user group, co-author of Windows PowerShell TFM 4th Edition,

5
00:00:37,5 --> 00:00:44,5
author of Chapter 6 in the PowerShell Deep Dives book, winner of the advanced category in the 2013 Scripting games.

6
00:00:44,5 --> 00:00:47,5
You're not here to learn about me, but if you want to know more about me, see my blog site.

7
00:00:47,5 --> 00:00:56,5
I blog every week. I've got about 400 blog articles out there. I've been blogging since 2009 and get most of

8
00:00:56,5 --> 00:01:02,5
my hits from Google searches or Bing searches and I get about 2,000 hits a day, so that should tell you what

9
00:01:02,5 --> 00:01:06,5
type of content I have.

10
00:01:06,5 --> 00:01:09,5
Okay, so I've got some questions for the audience. This one thing of

11
00:01:09,5 --> 00:01:13,5
the sessions I've seen this morning, I'm not just going to get up here and preach to you because I want to

12
00:01:13,5 --> 00:01:18,5
know what level you guys are at before I start that. I don't want to talk over your head, but I don't want

13
00:01:18,5 --> 00:01:21,5
to talk underneath you as well.

14
00:01:21,5 --> 00:01:25,5
So how many IT pros do we have in the room?

15
00:01:25,5 --> 00:01:32,5
Okay. And how many developers? Okay, looks like we've got a mix of people in the room.

16
00:01:32,5 --> 00:01:38,5
So okay, so how many people are using PowerShell V4 or higher?

17
00:01:38,5 --> 00:01:46,5
Hopefully, that's going to be everybody in the room. So hopefully everybody here is writing functions.

18
00:01:46,5 --> 00:01:54,5
Okay and modules? How many people in the room are using Desired State Configuration today?

19
00:01:54,5 --> 00:02:00,5
Okay, good. I'm glad I started with some questions because I probably would have been talking over your head.

20
00:02:00,5 --> 00:02:04,5
I would have assumed that everybody in the room is using Desired State Configuration.

21
00:02:04,5 --> 00:02:09,5
It looks like we've probably got less than half of the room who's using it.

22
00:02:09,5 --> 00:02:13,5
Okay and how many people are familiar with Public Key Infrastructure?

23
00:02:13,5 --> 00:02:17,5
Okay, if you're not familiar with that, you're going to use DSC, that's something you want to invest some

24
00:02:17,5 --> 00:02:24,5
time in learning because that's how you're going to prevent putting passwords in your MOF configuration

25
00:02:24,5 --> 00:02:31,5
documents that are in plaintext and that was a capability that was possible in PowerShell V4,

26
00:02:31,5 --> 00:02:36,5
but in version 5, you can actually encrypt the entire MOF document.

27
00:02:36,5 --> 00:02:42,5
So how many people are placing their PowerShell code in some type of source control system today?

28
00:02:42,5 --> 00:02:47,5
Good, I actually see more hands than I expected.

29
00:02:47,5 --> 00:02:52,5
Okay and how many people are using Pester or some type of unit testing for their PowerShell code?

30
00:02:52,5 --> 00:02:58,5
Good. These are things if you're not doing today and definitely invest some time in doing them,

31
00:02:58,5 --> 00:03:01,5
it'll save you a lot of time down the road.

32
00:03:01,5 --> 00:03:07,5
So what about your---I want to talk a little bit about job responsibilities.

33
00:03:07,5 --> 00:03:14,5
You're here at the PowerShell summit this week, so who is back on site doing your job this week?

34
00:03:14,5 --> 00:03:20,5
You know, if nobody has to be doing your job this week, then are you really needed, you know?

35
00:03:20,5 --> 00:03:26,5
And my question too is do you really trust the people that are there on site doing your job.

36
00:03:26,5 --> 00:03:32,5
Now hopefully, you've automated the majority of your job and I don't know about you guys, but I don't worry

37
00:03:32,5 --> 00:03:39,5
about automating myself out of a job because if I do, then I'll just find another one and do the same thing again.

38
00:03:39,5 --> 00:03:46,5
So anyway, what this session is really about is when you figure something out, create a tool to accomplish

39
00:03:46,5 --> 00:03:52,5
that task and then maybe you want to create some documentation. My documentation is my blog site.

40
00:03:52,5 --> 00:03:58,5
I left early Friday to take my wife out to dinner since I was going to be here this week.

41
00:03:58,5 --> 00:04:04,5
Well my boss calls me after work. He says, hey you know that code you wrote to do X, where can I find a copy of that?

42
00:04:04,5 --> 00:04:08,5
I said I'll give you one even better than that. Just go to my blog site, put in this key word.

43
00:04:08,5 --> 00:04:12,5
It'll be the only article that will come up. You'll not only find the code to do what you want to do,

44
00:04:12,5 --> 00:04:18,5
but it'll walk you through it step by step. So that was the end of the conversation and I was able to enjoy

45
00:04:18,5 --> 00:04:25,5
the rest of my evening, instead of having to get into the system remotely or spend usually most of these more

46
00:04:25,5 --> 00:04:31,5
complicated things, you can spend twice as long on the phone with somebody trying to explain to them than just

47
00:04:31,5 --> 00:04:38,5
do it yourself. But once you figure out how to do something right, a tool to accomplish it because if you

48
00:04:38,5 --> 00:04:44,5
don't do something for six months, unless you're a lot smarter than me, then you're not going to remember the

49
00:04:44,5 --> 00:04:51,5
details of how to accomplish that task. But you write a tool, you figure it out once, you write a tool,

50
00:04:51,5 --> 00:04:58,5
you never have to figure it out again unless things change like from PowerShell V4 to 5 with DSC,

51
00:04:58,5 --> 00:05:04,5
there are some differences. And I've got some tools that it, I try to make my tools version agnostic

52
00:05:04,5 --> 00:05:08,5
so it doesn't matter what version you're using.

53
00:05:08,5 --> 00:05:13,5
Okay, so the content we're going to cover in this session will briefly touch on all this, so we'll talk about

54
00:05:13,5 --> 00:05:20,5
DSC, Desired State Configuration, we'll talk about the Local Configuration Manager, Push mode, Pull mode,

55
00:05:20,5 --> 00:05:26,5
a little bit about DSC resources, some new features in PowerShell V5 as far as DSC goes, we'll talk about

56
00:05:26,5 --> 00:05:33,333
functions, modules, toolmaking, automation. It's not a deep dive into any one of those topics, but we'll touch

57
00:05:33,333 --> 00:59:59,999
on each one of those. So it's time for the demo.
