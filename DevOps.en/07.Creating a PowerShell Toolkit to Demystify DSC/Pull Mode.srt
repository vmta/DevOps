1
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,486
I've got a question. Sure, go for it.

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:11,486
The SMB share for your DSC resources on the pull server, in a push mode is there a way to specify alternate

3
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:17,486
credentials to get those resources? I'm not sure to be honest with you.

4
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:24,486
With the LCM, you can configure them. You can configure the credentials on the LCM, but I'm not sure it'll

5
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:33,486
use those in push mode. So if you're in pull mode, I mean, you can do that.

6
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:39,486
What I'll do, I'll actually test that after the session, and we'll find out.

7
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:46,486
Quick question. So if you're using partial configuration to kind of separate which department is handling

8
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:54,486
which configuration aspect on the system, is there any way to define like an order of operation or handle

9
00:00:54,486 --> 00:01:00,486
conflicts if they were to rise, like set a precedent for like, okay, I have this server admin portion

10
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:14,486
configuration for always trump whatever conflicts… It depends because if it finds a conflict, it just stops.

11
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:24,486
(Audience discussion) Yeah, that's what I would think too. I haven't actually tried that, but that's what

12
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:49,486
I've been told as well. (Audience comment)

13
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:55,486
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about pull mode. There are some new features in pull mode as well.

14
00:01:55,486 --> 00:02:01,486
So we have a SQL Server, we have all the default settings. What we're going to do is set the Local

15
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:09,486
Configuration Manager so that it will be in pull mode. This is actually compatible with version 4 and higher,

16
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:19,486
although, there is a new way to configure it in version 5. And the reason you need to know that is because

17
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:25,486
when you're querying the Local Configuration Manager, if you're designing a tool, you need to check both

18
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:31,486
locations if you're going to make your tool version agnostic. You want to check it to say, okay, is it set here,

19
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:35,486
and then if it's not set, then go ahead and check it somewhere else too.

20
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:44,486
Check it in the new location because the way you can configure this in V4, it's compatible with V5, so the machine

21
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:54,486
could be set one way and you'll---my point though will be a little bit clearer once we get this configured.

22
00:02:54,486 --> 00:03:00,486
Okay, so we create the MetaMOF, we go ahead and create it on SQL01, we take a look at the Local

23
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:09,486
Configuration Manager, now we're in pull mode and we have this DownloadManagerName and we have a SourcePath

24
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:18,486
up here as well. Usually, you have to expand these properties to see what's really set so you can see what's

25
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:27,486
it's a UNC path, but it's in a different location on the Local Configuration Manager.

26
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:34,486
So let's take a look at the modules that the DSC resources that are installed on SQL01.

27
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:40,486
So you'll notice that I've got one that I wrote probably a year ago that's called cMrSQLRecoveryModel.

28
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:49,486
I'm going to remove that, so now you see it, now you don't. We're going to define a structural configuration

29
00:03:49,486 --> 00:04:00,486
for both DC01 and SQL01. This is the same thing we did earlier, except we're defining one for two different

30
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:09,486
servers, two different types of servers. I've got a lot of comments in here that we're going to gloss over.

31
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:14,486
But like I said, this code is available already. I just want to look at---I want you to be able to see a

32
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:18,486
specific settings and I think this is actually the same thing I showed a couple of minutes ago.

33
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:24,486
So we did set a configuration id and we set it to refresh mode and the SMB path, as well.

34
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:31,486
So what we want to do now, we want to create a tool to automate the deployment of MOF configuration files to

35
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:39,486
the SMB share. So what needs to happen with that is the MOF configuration document needs to be renamed to

36
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:47,486
the configuration id on the Local Configuration Manager and then we have to create a checksum, which I already mentioned.

37
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:56,486
So we'll have a Publish-MrMOFToSMB tool. So if I take a look at that, it actually goes through, it checks several

38
00:04:56,486 --> 00:05:02,486
things, it checks to see if it's in pull mode. If it doesn't, it generates a meaningful error message.

39
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:08,486
It checks all these different locations that can be defined in V4 and V5.

40
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:14,486
That way, whoever's using this, they don't have to worry about oh well do this if it's V4 and do that if it's V5

41
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:20,486
because especially if you're talking to a junior level engineer, the last thing, this is confusing enough as

42
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:29,486
it is without having to know all the manually know if it's V4 do this and V5 do that.

43
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:38,486
Okay, so if we look at the SMB share for the SQL servers, the neat thing about this one, it'll actually read

44
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:41,486
the Local Configuration Manager settings,

45
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:46,486
so it'll get the configuration id, it'll do it all for you, so you don't have to put anything in manually.

46
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:47,486
The only thing we're doing is

47
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:52,486
running the configuration to create the MOF files just like you would normally do, but then you just pipe it

48
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:57,486
to the command I've created an it's going to do everything for you and put in on the SMB share with the checksum

49
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,486
and all of it.

50
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:04,486
And if you give it more than one computer name, which I've actually given it two here, if you give it more

51
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:10,486
than one computer name, if one is not in pull mode, it'll give you a meaningful error message, but it will go

52
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:16,486
through like 50 servers, and if it's got different settings to find in the LCM settings on the servers,

53
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:20,486
it'll put it on the different shares.

54
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:26,486
So when I run this and you'll notice we've got a meaningful error message and I know you can't hardly see that,

55
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:33,486
but that's for DC01, it's because we're still in push mode, so it stops and it gives the user of it, it says hey

56
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:38,486
DC01 is not in pull mode, so instead of them spending half a day troubleshooting this.

57
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:46,486
But now we have our MOF configuration documents for the SQL Server and I'll just highlight this again,

58
00:06:46,486 --> 00:07:04,486
so you'll be able to see it. So the other thing we need, I'll show this one more time, so we use the same

59
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:11,486
command before and this actually doesn't read the LCM settings, the command, we have to give it the SMB path,

60
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:17,486
but my thought process with that is normally, you're going to have a MOF configuration document per server

61
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:22,486
and I know you can have a group of servers and you can actually use the same configuration for multiple servers,

62
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:31,486
but with the resources, you probably don't want to publish the resource for every single server because

63
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:38,486
those are going to be, I might be using the PowerShellAccessControl module for multiple servers, and I don't

64
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:42,486
want to constantly be publishing that out.

65
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:54,486
So I'll go ahead and publish the required DSC resource out to the share,

66
00:07:54,486 --> 00:08:08,486
I'll take a look at the module folder on SQL01, in addition to that, I'll take a look at the configuration

67
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:19,486
folder on SQL01 where the pending MOF is going to end up. So you'll notice we have a previous MOF,

68
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:27,486
we're going to end up with a pending MOF here in a second. We'll pin that folder as well.

69
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:40,486
So we'll run Update-DscConfiguration for SQL01 to force it to pull the configuration and the DSC resource.

70
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:49,486
So you'll notice now we have a pending MOF, which will become current MOF once the configuration is successfully applied.

71
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:53,486
In the background, this is having to load the SQLPS module because I'm setting a recovery model in some SQL

72
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:59,486
Server databases with this resource, so that's why it took a little bit longer than normal.

73
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:05,486
But now you'll notice the current MOF was updated. So if the configuration failed to apply it, it would still

74
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:15,486
be called pending MOF. But also the DSC resource was sent to the server.

75
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:24,486
Okay. It's going to share the same thing in the event logs, the same thing as before, so there's nothing

76
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:33,486
really new here to see. It's putting the resources in the temp folder again.

77
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:40,486
So with PowerShell V5 for a pull server, there's a new location to configure the pull server settings for at

78
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:54,486
least an SMB share. Well I believe for the web server for HTTP or HTTPS, there's a new location as well.

79
00:09:54,486 --> 00:10:16,486
(Audience question) I know at least the way I just showed is I know that I could actually run, what is it,

80
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:24,486
Get-DscConfiguration and here on CimSession, you can actually just give it a computer name, you actually don't

81
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:33,486
have to give it a CimSession. So you can run that. You can also run Test-DscConfiguration, and in V5,

82
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:38,486
you've got a I believe a detailed parameter on Test-DscConfiguration that'll show you all the details,

83
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:52,486
not just the tree falls. (Audience question) It's magic. What…

84
00:10:52,486 --> 00:11:02,486
(Audience comment) I don't know the answer to that. That's a good question.

85
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:06,486
I've got two things. I actually really enjoy blogging. It's probably one of the things I enjoy doing,

86
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:12,486
so I've got two really good articles I'm going to write from questions in here, so keep them coming.

87
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:17,486
I think it doesn't need the CimSession because the computer name in front of it.

88
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:27,486
So if you don't need your credential… So you can see actually it says SQL01 is it says it's false.

89
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:43,486
Let's look at, let's say detailed. Hmm, that's interesting. (Working)

90
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:53,486
We'll run this one more time. Yeah,

91
00:11:53,486 --> 00:12:03,486
so I'll have to research that as well because it says it's not in the desired state.

92
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:15,486
Okay, so what I want to show you now is the DSC settings for an SMB pull server on PowerShell V5.

93
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:21,486
Not sure where I left off, but it won't hurt if we run this again. So we'll create the MetaMOF,

94
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:34,486
we'll apply it, and we'll actually, it's called ConfigurationDownloadManagers, we'll take a look at those settings.

95
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:40,486
So what I'm going to do here is query all three servers and show the LCM settings and I've kind of created

96
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:50,486
custom properties here, so you'll see these are what I would call it, and actually, we've got WEB01 in there twice.

97
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,486
So I didn't get an error message, so I'm going to run the command again.

98
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:57,486
I don't know why we had WEB01 in there. I've got gremlins today.

99
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:03,486
You'll see there's like three different paths you would have to check and we've got this pull mode for two

100
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:09,486
of them and then we've got a push mode for another one. So if you're pushing out like DSC resources,

101
00:13:09,486 --> 00:59:59,999
you would have to check all these different locations on the Local Configuration Manager.
