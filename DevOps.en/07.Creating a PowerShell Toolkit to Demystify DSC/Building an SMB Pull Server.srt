1
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:10,824
Okay, so we've got four VMs that we're working with that are running on this laptop computer.

2
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:19,824
They all have PowerShell V5 on them. We've got a domain, the servers, the three servers are running Windows

3
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:25,824
Server 2012 R2, Server Core and no GUI, which is what you really should be running.

4
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:29,824
GUI's don't belong on servers. If you do want to use a GUI to manage your environment or somebody on your

5
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:36,824
team does, that's fine, but manage it from the desktop, don't RDP into the server.

6
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:43,824
So PC01 is a Windows 10 machine that's, they're all in the same domain.

7
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:51,824
So for the purposes of this demo, what we're going to be working with is an SMB pull server and for those of

8
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:57,824
you who haven't worked with DSC, there's two modes of configuration delivery.

9
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:02,824
Even if you haven't worked with it, you probably know this, but push mode and pull mode, and push mode is the

10
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:09,824
default and it enacts the---it results in immediate delivery and the then next the configuration.

11
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,824
This script is heavily commented

12
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:18,824
and this script here is actually already on GitHub, and my presentations, repository uploaded it last night.

13
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:25,824
Now I have some bonus content. I may not get to that, but I've got to re-upload that one tonight.

14
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:30,824
So I want to show you, we'll just look at the root of the C drive on DC01.

15
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:40,824
We've got one SMB file share already and we've set the security on that as well, so Domain Admins has full

16
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:44,824
control and domain controllers has read access.

17
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:54,824
Now at one time I was setting my SMB shares for my DSC configurations and my resources, I was setting that to

18
00:01:54,824 --> 00:02:00,824
so domain computers had read access, but believe it or not, not every computer in your domain is a member of

19
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:13,824
domain computers, and specifically, domain controllers are not a member of domain computers.

20
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:17,824
So what I've done here, I've actually separated the environmental configuration from the structural

21
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:22,824
configuration and I'm not going to dive into that topic very much.

22
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:28,824
It's what I recommend, but if you have questions about that, I actually have a very detailed blog article

23
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:33,824
that I wrote for PowerShell magazine. You'll find a link in the code here.

24
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:42,824
And then also there's a good article, there's a lot of PowerShell documentation now on GitHub, if you weren't

25
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:51,824
aware of that, you can actually contribute to that, but there is a specific article that shows you how to do

26
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:52,824
this as well.

27
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:57,824
Now they're actually using a different AccessControl DSC resource than I'm using.

28
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:04,824
I'm using a SmbShare DSC resource. I've got the links to GitHub, but the AccessControl DSC resource was

29
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:11,824
written by Rhon Edwards and he spoke on that on access control last year at the PowerShell summit, so you can

30
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:18,824
find details about it on the YouTube videos. So what I'll do, I'll go ahead and define my structural

31
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:31,824
configuration, which is the logic. And the environmental configuration, I'm going to store that in a psd1 file.

32
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:38,824
I do want to show you something here. I'm going to change this just to something else, psd2 because I've seen

33
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:43,824
that, I've actually seen this written in some books that they say hey you could store this in a different file type.

34
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,824
That's not true.

35
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:54,824
So if I try to store the data in something other than a psd1 file, I mean you can store it in a variable,

36
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:59,824
and there are some benefits to shorten a variable instead of a psd1 file.

37
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:09,824
So if I try to run that and actually that did work, so maybe my testing was not valid.

38
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:23,824
So let's do text or actually text. (Working) Yeah, so that did work.

39
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:30,824
So maybe it was PowerShell V4 I was testing that on. Okay, for the purpose of this demo, we're going to

40
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:37,824
stick with the psd1 file. And see that's one of the things about PowerShell, if you think you know,

41
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:40,824
nobody knows everything about it, but if you think you know everything about it today, then just wait until

42
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:44,824
tomorrow because they'll change something.

43
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:48,824
Okay. What I also want you to notice is how all this code I've showed you so far is formatted.

44
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:56,824
So format your code for readability. Your future self will thank you for it, as well as your coworkers.

45
00:04:56,824 --> 00:05:01,824
And if you're looking for help online you're going to paste your code, to be honest with you, me, or nobody

46
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:06,824
else, if we can't read your code, then you're probably not going to get any help, but if it's really easy

47
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:12,824
to read your code, you're much more likely to get help.

48
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:17,824
Okay, so I'll just show you the psd1 file that we created. That's what it looks like.

49
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:24,824
It's actually a hash table and then it's an array of hash tables for each of the shares I'm going to create.

50
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:40,824
One of these shares already does exist. Okay, we'll create the MOF configuration document and we'll try to

51
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:46,824
apply the configuration with push mode. You'll notice we got an error message.

52
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:51,824
So I was in Kirk Munro's session last and he brought up a good point that read the message.

53
00:05:51,824 --> 00:06:02,824
You know, a lot of people they'll call somebody else over to get help from them or even they'll run the command

54
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:07,824
again and they'll get the same error. Read the error message because generally, it'll tell you exactly what

55
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:11,824
the probably is. And here, does anybody know why we got this error message?

56
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:20,824
(Audience comment) Okay, I'm actually highlight it. Yeah, that's better.

57
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:24,824
There you go. Okay and I'll just go ahead and tell you

58
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:31,824
it's because we don't have the DSC resources on the domain controller and remember we're running PowerShell V5 here.

59
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:37,824
So what are my options for getting my DSC resources on the domain controller?

60
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:45,324
I'll open this up. So you can see those are the default modules, not necessarily DSC resources, but that's the

61
00:06:45,324 --> 00:59:59,999
location I recommend putting your DSC resource in. It's not the only option, but it's the all users module path.
