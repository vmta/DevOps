00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:22,22
Hello. My name is Don Jones. Welcome to Stupid DSC Tricks. So this is not kind of a standard session that

2
00:00:22,22 --> 00:00:26,26
you might have already gotten used to in your short time here at summit.

3
00:00:26,26 --> 00:00:31,31
We're not going to look at a lot of code, and we're not going to do a lot of demo, and we're also not going to

4
00:00:31,31 --> 00:00:35,35
do a lot of slides. We're hopefully, going to do a lot of talking and discussing.

5
00:00:35,35 --> 00:00:44,44
As a, I've been working with DSC for a couple years it's been out now, right, v4, you spend a lot of time

6
00:00:44,44 --> 00:00:50,50
talking to different people who kind of have the base idea of what DSC is supposed to do like from a business perspective.

7
00:00:50,50 --> 00:00:54,54
Alright, for example, one of the things you can tell people is look DSC is at the end of the day very similar

8
00:00:54,54 --> 00:00:59,59
to Group Policy, right? You're going to have this policy-based thing that tells your computers how to,

9
00:00:59,59 --> 00:01:03,63
what to be, and you're going to ship it out through some magically method and the computer will just do that stuff.

10
00:01:03,63 --> 00:01:08,68
So I mean super, super high-level, very similar. And so they start digging into it, well can I do this,

11
00:01:08,68 --> 00:01:16,76
can I do this, well no, I mean not really how it's designed. You've got to rethink your philosophy.

12
00:01:16,76 --> 00:01:25,85
So over the past month or so, Murawski, Dave Wyatt, and I have kind of been having this informal bounce back

13
00:01:25,85 --> 00:01:32,92
and forth Exchange about some of the ways we could get DSC to do stuff that maybe it wasn't specifically

14
00:01:32,92 --> 00:01:37,97
designed to do. Not that it's bad, but kind of hacking it. Like where could we really just like jam your

15
00:01:37,97 --> 00:01:43,103
fist in its mouth and make it do what you wanted it to whether it wanted to or not and that kind of spilled out.

16
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,107
We have a private Slack channel for the folks that come to my DSC DevOps camp.

17
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:53,113
It's about 20 folks who were there last year, and so these are folks who have their brains connected to

18
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:58,118
PowerShell 24/7 and they're doing DSC and they're doing DevOps and they're running into the problems and

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:04,124
they're trying to get creative about solving the problems and everything else, and so we start going back and

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:10,130
we start kind of coming up with ideas of ways we can do different stuff that when you look at the DSC PowerPoint

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,134
slide, you're like no, it could never do that, but maybe it could.

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:20,140
So I thought this would kind of be a nice place because I know a lot of you---how many of you are using PowerShell?

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,145
Oh, that's reassuring. Good, that did not happen the last time I did this.

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,148
And how many of you are using DSC? Even just fussing with it in a pilot?

25
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:34,154
Okay, good. So I thought this would be a good crowd to bounce some ideas off of and maybe have folks say

26
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:40,160
well what about how could you do this and see if we can come up with some approaches, right.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,162
So that's kind of what we're doing.

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:50,170
Oh, by the way, you guys have seen this slide before, right. Quick round of applause for all the folks who'veâ€¦

29
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,175
I'm really proud of the fact that---I don't know if you know, it's a little bit rare on a lot of product

30
00:02:55,175 --> 00:03:00,180
teams at Microsoft for people to stick around for a decade. Alright, it's an easy company to move around and

31
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,185
you want to move onto something exciting and new, so it's pretty cool that there are so many people who've been

32
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
around that long.

33
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,190
So this is really meant to be kind of a brainstorming session, a think-outside-the-box session.

34
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:16,196
Let's talk about some things that we'd love for DSC to be able to do for us as a business,

35
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,200
right, forget the technology. Anything should be possible if we have enough money.

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,205
So let's just think about what we want it to do and then get a little bit outside the envelope and think

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:31,211
about how we could force it to do it. So I'll kind of kick things off with an example, which is

38
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:39,219
this one, dynamic printer mapping. Now talk yourself through how DSC works, right.

39
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:46,226
You sit on your computer, you, the author, you sit on your computer, and you type out a PowerShell script,

40
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,230
a configuration script, right, and it can have lots of logic in it.

41
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:58,238
You can have if blocks and loops and all kinds of crazy stuff in there, yeah, and you push run, and what's it produce?

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,243
MOF. MOF. One or more MOFs, right, Management Object Format, MOF file.

43
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,248
A MOF file is just text file. It's not code. Now you can have little snippets in there if you do a certain

44
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,252
type of resource called the script resource, but generally speaking, a MOF is static.

45
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:21,261
This MOF is what I want that computer to look like and I created that description completely out of context.

46
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:26,266
I didn't run it on that computer. I'm running it at a totally different place in time.

47
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm just giving it to that computer and that computer then runs that, but the computer doesn't think about it.

48
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:38,278
Right, the MOF says you need to be a domain controller. You need this IP address, you need to be running

49
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,282
these services, you need these files copied over, don't ask questions, don't make decisions, don't think about

50
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:49,289
it, I'm not interested in your opinion, just do it. Now what we tell people is in a server workload,

51
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,294
that's kind of okay, right, because servers we tend to set them up, we want them one way, and then we try

52
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,299
really hard to make them never change, right, that's why we have ITIL, right, stop all change.

53
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:07,307
That's what that means. And but it doesn't apply so well to client scenarios because clients are,

54
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:14,314
client computers, well who uses a client computer? Users, right, and they're squishy.

55
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:20,320
They're people. They move around, they get up, they change jobs, they install Elf bowling,

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:29,329
they uninstall this, there are changes. Well one of the neat things about Group Policy is you don't actually

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:36,336
set up all the policy decisions up front. Some of the decisions get made by the client as it downloads it,

58
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:42,342
right, what organizational unit are you in, what domain are you in, what site are you in, what user groups

59
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:50,350
are you in, what WMI filter type things are going on? So it can be very, very kind of dynamic and customized

60
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,354
and the Group Policy you get today might be slightly different from the one you get tomorrow.

61
00:05:54,354 --> 00:06:00,360
Well that's not what DSC really does. DSC just says be this always.

62
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,367
Now obviously there's certain client's computer scenarios, you think kiosks or if you work at a bank and

63
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,371
you've got those floors full of phone slaves, you want all those computers to be exactly the same all the

64
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:21,381
time, sure, but most users are squishier than that. And so, one example is dynamic printer mapping.

65
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:28,388
Now if I'm writing a DSC configuration script, I can certainly have a printer resource that says install such

66
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:36,396
and such printer. Right, no problem. But if I tell you to install the printer for Building A and you run

67
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:41,401
over to Building B for a week, how do I get you a printer over there?

68
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:47,407
Right, it's not---there's no evaluation. The LCM, the Local Configuration Manager, as it's reading that MOF

69
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:52,412
doesn't have the ability to say alright we're going to do printer mapping now, so it says map into Printer A,

70
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,416
but gosh, I just know he's not over in that building right now, so I'm going to pick a different printer.

71
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:01,421
It doesn't do that. There's no logic in the LCM, it's just following a set of instructions and calling a

72
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:06,426
bunch of resources. So this is one of the first problems we started down because it's one of the first

73
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:11,431
things that comes up in a discussion when you're trying to explain to someone why DSC and Group Policy are

74
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:17,437
different, and we thought we could totally do this with DSC, completely.

75
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:24,444
How? All we have to do is write a resource that dynamically maps printers based on some criteria.

76
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:35,455
So in your configuration script, you say whatever the resource name is, map a printer, yes, map nearest printer,

77
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:41,461
yes, and that's all that goes into your MOF. Your MOF just knows that it's supposed to map a printer.

78
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:46,466
That's it. The MOF doesn't know where the printer is, doesn't know where it should map it to, it doesn't care

79
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:54,474
about any of that, so when you compile that MOF, you create that text file, you slam it out to all your nodes,

80
00:07:54,474 --> 00:08:03,483
it runs a DSC resource, which is just PowerShell code, or can be, right, and that PowerShell code goes oh,

81
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,487
okay, I'm supposed to map a printer, great. What's my IP address right now?

82
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,491
Let me go see what Active Directory site I'm in. I can figure that out locally.

83
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,494
I can actually go see a list of published printers in Active Directory and find one that's near me and I'm

84
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:21,501
going to go ahead and map that. So the dynamism, in that case, lives on the client computer.

85
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:27,507
It's not in the LCM. The LCM is still relatively dumb, but the LCM is calling on a smarter friend who can

86
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:33,513
make that runtime decision. And we started thinking it was some of the ramifications of that, right,

87
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:40,520
because you have that idea and then you put your third drink down and you start to think is this a good idea,

88
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,525
and after three drinks, obviously it's a great idea. So the next morning we thought, alright, so what are

89
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:52,532
some of the ramifications of this. Well how often does the LCM run a consistency check, by default?

90
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:58,538
Fifteen minutes. Is it going to be bad for that thing to be constantly trying to remap a printer?

91
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:05,545
Well, if you have it go look at what printer it should map and then just check to see if that one's already

92
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:11,551
mapped, and if it is, well don't do anything, which is how resources are supposed to be written, right.

93
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:17,557
Don't do anything until you test first, right, run test. Only run set if you have to.

94
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:22,562
Well, maybe that wouldn't be too bad. And we actually---how many of you work for healthcare?

95
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,567
Yep, there's always a couple. We actually thought, you know what, this would actually solve a couple of really

96
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:33,573
cool scenarios because you get into a hospital situation and the doctor runs from room to room to room and he's

97
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,577
logging on different profiles, but he wants his profile to be mapped to the printer that's in that room right

98
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:42,582
then, so he's not printing out someone's personal information six rooms down, right, so we thought actually

99
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:48,588
this whole really frequent dynamic remapping thing in certain scenarios could be kind of cool.

100
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,592
But we stopped thinking about that because healthcare freaks us all out because blood, gross.

101
00:09:52,592 --> 00:10:01,601
So what do you think? Comments? Have anybody ever thought of going after it that way?

102
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,605
One thing you're going to have to think about is unmapping a map forâ€¦

103
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:13,613
Oh, and when do I unmap it? Yeah. We thought about that too. Partially, we weren't sure if we cared or not

104
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:21,621
because I guess what it was is in that we figured if the test runs and you're mapped to the one you should be,

105
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:28,628
don't do anything, but if you're not, then just go unmap whatever was there and then map whatever you should

106
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,632
be right then. It kind of depends on the business situation, right.

107
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,636
If you've got some HR person who's got a local printer you don't want to unmap, you'd have to have some way

108
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:41,641
of accounting for that, yeah. Yeah, we kind of walked through that a little bit.

109
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,645
What else? What if you're not on the network? What if you're not on the network?

110
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,649
Well then you're not going to be printing, so it's not a problem.

111
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:56,656
(Audience comment) Well yeah, it might. That, again, all gets down to your test, right, or your set.

112
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:01,661
We had a little bit of argument about where we'd put those. I think we eventually decided maybe both.

113
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,663
But your set should certainly say look are we even on a network here?

114
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,668
I mean maybe we don't have the right printer, but is it even possible, and if not, forget it.

115
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:14,674
That's more doing exactly the right thing is what you're doing, is you're now, what are the failure scenarios

116
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,678
I might run into and let's account for those, so we're not just spewing errors into the log, but yeah,

117
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,682
you do have to walk through that. What else? You might be able to develop some tests, I mean, I'm not on

118
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,686
the network, I have no printer, I mean that's what the test would look at.

119
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,691
Yeah and that was actually my argument is in the test, first check to see if I can even possibly get to a

120
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,695
valid state, and if I'm not, just say true, so we don't even run the set.

121
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:48,708
(Audience question) Yeah, so how do you determine the locality to a printer?

122
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:57,717
That's your problem, right. And I say that with all love, but the fact is, we're all going to have a

123
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,722
different set of business rules for how we do that and what we're talking about here is you're going to have

124
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,726
to build a certain amount of infrastructure potentially to let you do that.

125
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,731
Some people might have databases. Some people might have something they put into Active Directory.

126
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,734
I've got plenty of customers who don't have all their client computers in Active Directory, and so they're

127
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,739
going to have to have some other place to look it up. Maybe there's a SQL Server.

128
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:25,745
Maybe you've got some back-end tool or something. So yeah, you're going to have to do all that, right,

129
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:31,751
those are things. I don't call them challenges, they're just part of what you would have to solve as part of it.

130
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:37,757
What if say your nearest printer is down. Now see but let me pause you real quick.

131
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:43,763
Before we go down the rabbit hole of making this a printer mapping session, I want to point out that what you

132
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:49,769
guys are thinking about are the right questions. We're not trying to solve the printer mapping module here today.

133
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,776
What we're trying to do is make DSC do stuff that it is initially not designed to do.

134
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:02,782
All of those questions are answerable. We could code an answer to all of those.

135
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,787
It might mean having to have a directory of printers and who's allowed to use one or whatever, which actually gives

136
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:15,795
you more control and flexibility than you probably have today. We can do those things, but the point is

137
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:21,801
getting DSC to a point where it can let us do those things. So yeah, we do have to have all those things.

138
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,805
What else we can get to is there like an alternative configuration or a second configuration?

139
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,809
There is no alternative configuration. In fact, let's talk about that.

140
00:13:29,809 --> 00:59:59,999
ESPN, you and me, we had it yesterday too.
