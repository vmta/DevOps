1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,087
What else? Who else is moving toward a servers are cattle, not pets, kind of environment and are using DSC to

2
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:20,087
help with that in some ways? Yeah? (Audience comment) Good. DSC and Chef, yeah.

3
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:24,087
And it works? You're standing, so I'm assuming that there hasn't been a blood bath.

4
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:29,087
Not yet. Not yet. It's possible. You just have to decide that you're going to change your processes.

5
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:38,087
And you know what, if there's a theme to this whole discussion, it's forget what you know and think about fresh, right.

6
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:44,087
That's what this whole thing is. Forget what DSCs architecture is as you've been told.

7
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:48,087
What could you do with it if you just stepped outside of the lines a little bit?

8
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:54,087
Forget about well you've got to have a machine name. Do you really?

9
00:00:54,087 --> 00:01:00,087
Right. So just step outside those lines a bit. What are some other architectural things that you wish DSC did

10
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:06,087
that you just don't think it can do? Oh, that's right. Everyone's completely happy with the product and

11
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:21,087
doesn't want any changes to it. I forgot. (Audience comment) Ah, that is actually really good.

12
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:27,087
Dave Wyatt and I have an argument about this and I'm afraid he's right, the bastard, because I wanted to make,

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:33,087
so the question was what about one DSC resource calling another DSC resource and you might think why would

14
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:44,087
you do that? Well here's a really good example. Let's say I wanted to write a dynamic evaluation resource.

15
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:51,087
Okay, so in my configuration script, it would say pick a basic resource that you like.

16
00:01:51,087 --> 00:02:03,087
Oh, that's good. File. So let's say we only want a copy of this file if this thing in WMI is set to this value,

17
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:09,087
right, something like that. So my idea was we'll write a resource and let's query this WMI class, compare it to

18
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:17,087
this value, and if it's true, run the file resource with tab to indent these settings.

19
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:25,087
If it's not true, tab to indent, run the file resource with these settings instead, right.

20
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:31,087
And so we kind of went down this and I said so look and there are two answers.

21
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:41,087
Answer one, if you are using function-based resources, you can totally do this because they're just modules.

22
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:48,087
So you're if then resource, if we can call it that, can we call it that if then, your if then resource can

23
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:54,087
just go load the module into its scope and call the test in a set and it can just manually pretend that it's

24
00:02:54,087 --> 00:03:01,087
the LCM and run those things. It's a little harder with class-based resources because if a class-based

25
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:07,087
resource attempts to instantiate another one, you actually get an error saying that there's a configuration,

26
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:12,087
a consistency check already in progress, like the LCM gets involved and stomps on you.

27
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:18,087
So we haven't figured out a work-a-round for that yet. But for function-based ones, you can have one

28
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:24,087
resource call another. Class ones, I still think there has to be a way to step out of the scope and get into it,

29
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:31,087
but we haven't gotten it to do what we want quite yet. (Audience question)

30
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,087
Sure. Change the INI file, restart the server. We still have INI files?

31
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:45,087
That's awesome. I love INI files. What else? Anybody tried to do anything crazy with DSC or are you just

32
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:52,087
doing like file, package, network, firewall. Yeah, just the basics.

33
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,087
Nah, go home and get crazy with it. Go nuts with it. Try weird stuff.

34
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:59,087
Set yourself up a little lab. What do you need like three machines, client, server, pull server.

35
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:04,087
Do crazy stuff because crazy stuff is how we break it and crazy stuff is how we break push the edges.

36
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:09,087
And until we try to break it, nobody can fix it, so we have to try and break it first and let's find out

37
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:14,087
where it's not doing what we think it needs to do so that we can tell the team because that's really what

38
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:19,087
they want to hear, right, they know they're just guessing as to what we need based on conversations they've

39
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:24,087
had, but they need more conversations and we've got to try and break stuff, we've got to try and push the

40
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:28,087
edges of it and find out you know what this model would work really well except for this one thing it won't

41
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:35,087
let me do. Can you take that off? Make a case for it. Reporting's tooling.

42
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:42,087
Yeah, go ahead. One thing I'd like to see is something to deploy the DSC in an existing machine so you

43
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:48,087
generate configuration like based out of this becauseâ€¦ Sure, point DSC at a machine and have it just

44
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:55,087
generate a config for how that machine is set up. Two responses, response number one, that's tooling, right,

45
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,087
that's not so we got to make sure we're differentiating between platform and tooling.

46
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:02,087
DSC is not tooling. DSC is platform. So what you're after is a tool because that's not something you're

47
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:05,087
going to do every five minutes. You're going do it as a provisioning thing.

48
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:09,087
We'd also like tools to do reporting for God's sake, that'd be nice.

49
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:13,087
We'd like tools to be able to keep track of what config was supposed to go to what machine.

50
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,087
That'd be great. All that will be called system center expensive something, something, something, something

51
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:22,087
I'm sure, one day. So we'll diverge to tooling for just a second.

52
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:28,087
I don't think you do want that. I think people think they want that and I hear that a lot, but let's go down

53
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:34,087
that rabbit hole a little bit because when you point that thing at that machine, is it just going to enumerate

54
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:44,087
every single registry key, file, service, process ever? Or is it supposed to compare like a base OS with?

55
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:53,087
It gets really tough and Windows has got 632 quad zillion management points and it doesn't know which one you care about.

56
00:05:53,087 --> 00:06:01,087
Now what I would say is that it's probably legit to ask for a tool like the packaging tools used to do where

57
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:07,087
it can watch. Yes. Right. Okay, I've got everything up. Here's my base image.

58
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:15,087
Begin watching. Yeah, but except people make that. Right, that's what, oh heck, they used to be a sponsor

59
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:27,087
of us, dev power people with stuff, ScriptRock. UpGuard now. Oh, they did change their name.

60
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:32,087
No one knows why. Yeah, so there are people who do that. You're going to have to pay for it, but you know

61
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:37,087
if you want nice things, you have to pay for them. I'm not sure I would ever expect Microsoft to produce

62
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:44,087
that tool just because they've declined to do so in so many different iterations, the exception being App-V.

63
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:50,087
Right, which is part of how App-V, that's how you App-Vify an app as they watch it while you install it.

64
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:56,087
But they bought that from someone else, so it's hard to tell. But yeah, those tools exist.

65
00:06:56,087 --> 00:07:02,087
Now what they don't currently do, what UpGuard does not do is make a MOF out of that, but I think that's just

66
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:06,087
a matter of enough customers saying you know what we'd really like.

67
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:14,087
How about installing MSU files? Installing? MSU files. Installing MSU, you mean patches?

68
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:20,087
I don't know. I go back and forth on that one. I don't view DSC as a patch deployment mechanism.

69
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:26,087
But what if you need a specific patch? Oh, you just need one like on a short term thing?

70
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:31,087
Short of just because that system for your business case needs this patch in place.

71
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:36,087
Yeah. And you want to make sure that it's on there, but not maybe necessarily run the entire Windows update.

72
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:40,087
I'm not sure. I go back and forth. I'm not saying you're wrong.

73
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:53,087
I'm just going to imply it. (Audience comment) And part of me says that DSC can't be the one tool you use

74
00:07:53,087 --> 00:08:00,087
to maintain your entire infrastructure and that the best use of DSC for a software deployment situation would

75
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:06,087
be to use DSC to make sure that you're software deployment solution is installed and active and running and

76
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:11,087
then use your software deployment solution to push files and crap.

77
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:16,087
And the reason I say that is because software deployment is such a thing.

78
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,087
You have to track status because you want to be able to query it.

79
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:23,087
You have to have distribution points. You have to worry about WAN links when you're pulling software and I

80
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:28,087
just think that starts to get outside of basic config. I think your basic config is make sure that this

81
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:35,087
other solution is configured so that it will do its job. That's kind of where I sit.

82
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:41,087
We're in this weird space with software deployment right now. My suspicion is that as Microsoft moves more

83
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:47,087
and more toward a cloud command and control in tune style stuff with maybe on-prem distribution points,

84
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:54,087
you'll start to see that becoming easier. I think right now it's great to say just use DSC to configure your

85
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:58,087
patch management and software deployment solution, except we really don't have a great one.

86
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:07,087
We've got Windows update and SCCM and that's it. Can't we call it sick 'em anymore?

87
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:12,087
So yeah, that's kind of one of the reasons I'm not really looking for the package resource to be all that awesome.

88
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:22,087
To a point, like to the Yum RPM level sure, but I don't really want to see DSC become a whole software

89
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:26,087
deployment solution because we already have so many of them and they all suck.

90
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:31,087
So I'd rather get one of the ones we have working, but that's something fun to talk about.

91
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,087
Let's drink and talk about that because it's more interesting. Yeah.

92
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:39,087
So the squishy metaphor like where users and DevOpsâ€¦ That's not a metaphor.

93
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:50,087
People are squishy. Try it, poke him. Squishy. So after the point there, I can see that argument there,

94
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:57,087
but for the service where it's maybe there's just the one application they want and really the particular

95
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:03,087
latest version ofâ€¦ No, no, I think you and I are on the same page there.

96
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:07,087
I think as you get into a server and your goal is to provision a server and you need this management agent

97
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:13,087
and you need this and this and this, you need to get it to the point where it can participate in the rest of the infrastructure.

98
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:22,087
I think that's a legitimate use for DSC being able to deploy packages contingent on A, us getting something

99
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:26,087
that really works well like PowerShell Package Manager hopefully will for us, right.

100
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:34,087
We need a Yum RPM Package Manager, not just giant file full of Windows Installer files and it'd be really

101
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:37,087
nice if we could just burn Windows Installer to the ground and never look at it again.

102
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:42,087
That'd be great because it's the source of most problems because people build crappy packages.

103
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:47,087
Not that Windows Installer is bad, it's what people do with it, right, guns don't kill people, developers kill people.

104
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:59,087
So it's basically that. So I think there is definitely---this almost gets into the DevOps-ish world, right,

105
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:05,087
do we have, no we don't have time. Well sometime when we're drinking, get me to tell you my whole DevOps story

106
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:10,087
and that kind of fits in it well. One more question all the way in the back.

107
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:20,087
He was first. (Audience question) In doing who? Networking. Networking.

108
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:25,087
Love it. Switch. Oh, you mean like using DSC to manage switches and stuff?

109
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:32,087
Yeah, so that's pretty much your job to pressure your network vendor because Microsoft has already done all

110
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:38,087
the work they need to do in that space. They've created a reference OMI stack, right.

111
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:47,087
OMI is basically a super lightweight WS-MAN stack and a super lightweight CIM repository that doesn't require a repository.

112
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:52,087
It's all in memory, so it's designed to run small footprint, small processor, it's designed to run in embedded

113
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:58,087
devices like switches and there's at least one company, Dell, that's already jumping on this bandwagon and you

114
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:04,087
can shove them off into one of their switches and it'll do it. So that's happening.

115
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:07,087
You've just got to make your vendor jump on board. Who's your vendor?

116
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:12,087
Cisco? It will be Cisco and Azure. Yep, have fun. Good luck with that.

117
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:17,087
(Audience comment) Cisco and some of their stuff is, yeah, and they'll roll it across generations.

118
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:22,087
The fact is that Microsoft with DSC did the most intelligent thing I've seen the company do in a long time

119
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:28,087
and they didn't invent a lot of new crap. They just adopted standards that we're already out there, and so for

120
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:33,087
other companies to jump on doesn't mean they have to bow down to Redmond, they're just doing what the rest of

121
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:39,087
the industry had already decided, but not actually implement it. Microsoft was the first to put a big

122
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:44,087
implementation out there and got the ball rolling, so that's already happening.

123
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:49,087
So look, cool. Guys, we're at the end. Thanks very much and enjoy the dinner on tonight.

124
00:12:49,087 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you. And let's keep talking and having ideas. Yeah.
