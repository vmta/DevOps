1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,388
So that's really all I have. If there are any more questions, let me know.  Oh.

2
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:15,388
Instead of breakpoints changing every Class method call, if my Test method calls my Get method, does that reset

3
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,388
the breakpoint as well?

4
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:25,388
All the breakpoints that are set within that specific method call remain.

5
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:30,388
So like if you're calling helper functions or helper methods within like say the test or the set,

6
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:36,388
those all work fine, but the next time like if it goes from Get to, so like sayâ€¦

7
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:38,388
(Audience comment)

8
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:45,388
Yeah, so I get, yeah, so the next time it's a new method call then I'll reset at that point.

9
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:48,388
Any other questions?

10
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:56,388
And that's actually because Get, Set, Test through the DSC Get call is there to send up, gets one call

11
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:59,388
and one of them it

12
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:01,388
creates a new runspace, that's why these don't affect us.

13
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:06,388
Actually sometimes it creates a new runspace. So the question is or the comment is that there's a new

14
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:10,388
runspace created for each of the method calls. That's sometimes true.

15
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:16,388
I know that they do create new runspaces, but mostly they recycle, and so there's actually a reset function

16
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:21,388
that you can call and part of that reset is to reset when you set reset runspaces, everything is cleared

17
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:26,388
including the breakpoints. I think it can be modified so that you say oh reset this runspace, but keep the

18
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:33,388
breakpoints because I'm running this in a context where it's the same class or something, so you know that

19
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:39,388
you want to keep the breakpoints. So I think that can be addressed and again there's a bug tracking it right

20
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:42,388
now, so I think it will be at some point.

21
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:46,388
Okay, well I think that's all I have then. Oh, contact information.

22
00:01:46,388 --> 00:02:02,388
Feel free to contact me through MVP, or GitHub, or whatever. We try to keep tabs on all kinds of different areas.

23
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:09,388
I'm happy to talk to you, or after the meeting as well, or take any comments that you have.

24
00:02:09,388 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you very much.
