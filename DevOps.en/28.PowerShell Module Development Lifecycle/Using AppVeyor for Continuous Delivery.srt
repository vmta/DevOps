1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,938
Alright, so now let's say I go in here and I am

2
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:12,938
actually editing my module and for whatever reason, I'm just looking at this and I'm like oh dude, why did you

3
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:17,938
put less than there, that should be greater than. And I don't have anyone code review this.

4
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:26,938
I don't run any of the tests. I just change this and I'm like I'm super smart, I'm just going to fixing the module.

5
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:35,938
So I fix the module, commit it, sync it, everything's happy. I'm a good developer, I'm using source control,

6
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:42,938
I am done, but the problem is now that I've checked this in, obviously the test is going to fail because all

7
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:47,938
my tests are going to fail because I've changed this logic that is incorrect, but without any kind of auditing

8
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:54,938
in place, there's no way for me to know that happened. So what we can do is we can actually integrate with a

9
00:00:54,938 --> 00:01:01,938
continuous integration system. So one available continuous integration system is AppVeyor.

10
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:06,938
AppVeyor is like it says a continuous delivery service for Windows and it's used by a lot of projects.

11
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:11,938
It's actually, I'm starting to see a lots and lots of projects using this and it's really cool because it's

12
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:19,938
free for open source projects. You can pay for plans. I think the big thing with unpaid subscriptions is

13
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:23,938
you get in a queue and sometimes it takes longer for your build to actually happen.

14
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,938
So once you sign in, you can actually sign in with your GitHub credentials and it's automatically linked to

15
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:34,938
your GitHub account. And you can see here, I have a couple different builds that I've set up, but what you're

16
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:40,938
going to want to click is the New Project button. So the New Project button, since it's linked to my GitHub

17
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:46,5
account, it just lists all the repositories that I have. So now I have my LoremIpsum account and I can just

18
00:01:46,5 --> 00:01:52,938
click this handy dandy Add button here. Alright, so now I have my build set up.

19
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:59,938
So what you can see here is there's no latest build. It automatically tracks changes in the GitHub repo,

20
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:00,938
so anytime

21
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:05,938
I commit a new change to my repo, it will automatically start a build,

22
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,938
but you can modify a lot of those settings here on the right-hand side.

23
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:13,938
There's a bunch of settings for AppVeyor. I'm not going to go through all these, but there's certain things

24
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:19,938
like only building certain branches, building only with certain tags, that kind of thing, building on a schedule.

25
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:24,938
You can also set things like environment, so they have different images that you can work with.

26
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:29,938
You can set environment variables. You can have it run tests, you can have it run build scripts, you can have

27
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:35,938
it deploy certain places, so we could automatically have it deployed to GitHub releases or something like that.

28
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:39,938
And then there's all kinds of other stuff. What's really important is you've got to make sure you get your

29
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:46,938
cool badge on GitHub repo that the build is passing. And then one recommendation that I always have with

30
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:51,938
AppVeyor is that you don't actually set all these settings in here and use this because it's really hard to

31
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:58,938
audit changes inside this GUI. What you want to do is actually make the changes in there, save it, and then grab

32
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:00,938
the appveyor.yml file.

33
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:07,938
So YAML is Yet Another Markup Language is what it stands for and it's actually a really simple syntax and it

34
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:12,938
just the appveyor.yml file can contain all your settings that you would put in this UI.

35
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:17,938
So then you can check it into your repo and when you put it in the base folder of your repo, what it'll actually

36
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:25,938
do is read that instead of the settings here and then it'll set up your AppVeyor build based on that, rather than this.

37
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:31,938
So if we went and actually went and built this, so what you're going to notice is it's going to start a build

38
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:39,938
and because I'm cheap, I don't actually have a paid subscription for this, so you're going to notice it

39
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:45,938
queues it, so that's what this status is marked here. It's queued and it's going to flash this little blue thing

40
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:53,938
until it starts. And then eventually it will finish the build. Luckily, I took some screen shots of this,

41
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:57,938
so we don't have to wait the entire time for this to happen, but

42
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,938
I'll go back and show you guys as it finishes sort of thing. So what you're going to notice the first time

43
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:07,938
you build a PowerShell module with AppVeyor without setting any settings is you're going to get an error.

44
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:16,938
So the error here is that, oh man, error here is that you need to specify a project or solution file.

45
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:22,938
The directory does not contain a project or solution file. That's because AppVeyor is kind of set up for .NET code.

46
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:27,938
It's looking for a Visual Studio solution or project in the root directory that it can build, and since we're

47
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:37,938
building a PowerShell module, we don't have that. So what we need to do is actually change the way that AppVeyor builds.

48
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:43,938
So there's a couple ways that you can do that. If you look in the settings, you can actually just turn off builds

49
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,938
and then you won't get that error anymore, but it won't do anything.

50
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:53,938
You could also just run a script and what's nice with AppVeyor is you can select PowerShell script and then

51
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:58,938
and use whatever cmdlets you want to actually build your PowerShell module.

52
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:02,938
In this case, you might have noticed that when I was checking, I was creating my module, I don't have a

53
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:03,938
module manifest here.

54
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:09,938
So one nice thing that we can do then is during our build, actually generate that module manifest on the fly,

55
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:15,938
And since the module manifest has a version and AppVeyor has a version, what we can do is we can get that

56
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:21,938
version dynamically and set it into our module manifest. So

57
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:28,938
what I did is I actually created a appveyor.yml file and let's take a look at that.

58
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:35,938
Actually what I'm going to do is copy that into output directory and then open it from there.

59
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:41,938
Alright, so here's a YML file. It looks very similar to the one that I showed that was up on there.

60
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:48,938
It sets the version syntax or the form that you want for your version, in this case, it's 1.0, and then this

61
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:54,938
will increment every build. Then I'm using the build_script keyword and specifying that it's PowerShell

62
00:05:54,938 --> 00:06:01,938
script to call New-ModuleManifest, and in there, I can actually set the module version using the

63
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:04,938
ModuleVersion parameter and use an environment variable that AppVeyor provides.

64
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:10,938
So AppVeyor has a bunch of different module or environment variables that you can specify, one of them being

65
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:15,938
the current build version, so it'll set those before it actually executes anything for your build.

66
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:22,938
And then I set just a bunch of other properties for my module and what I can do is I can actually go and

67
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:30,938
check that in, so Adding my appveyor.yml. One thing I noticed that you need to be careful of is make sure

68
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:37,938
that appveyor.yml is all lowercase. For whatever reason if it's camelcase, it will not work.

69
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:44,938
Alright, so now go back, okay, so yeah we finally got that error actually in AppVeyor.

70
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:50,938
What we'll notice here is once this syncs, it actually picked up on the fact that I committed a new change up

71
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:57,938
to AppVeyor, so now it's actually running a new build up there. So as that goes, what you'll see is it's

72
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:02,938
going to generate the module manifest and it's going to succeed and it's going to look a lot like this.

73
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:10,938
So I created a new module manifest, here I'll zoom in on that a little, go, or I won't zoom in on it a little.

74
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:13,938
Okay. And you can see the whole command-line, which is kind of cool.

75
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:20,938
So it cloned it, it checked it out, it called New-ModuleManifest, and then the build is success.

76
00:07:20,938 --> 00:59:59,999
It didn't find any tests or anything like that and we're good to go. But---
