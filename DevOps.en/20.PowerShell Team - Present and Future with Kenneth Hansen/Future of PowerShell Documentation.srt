00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,931
So thanks for letting me swing by. I've been in PowerShell 14, 15 days.

2
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:13,931
Wahoo! Not bad. Thank you very much. So I've been at the company for about 17, I'm with Microsoft for about

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:21,931
17 years in a lot of different roles, everything from evangelism, to developer support to ultimately landing

4
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:27,931
in SQL Server and the data platform. Up until a couple weeks ago, I was the director of content publishing

5
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:33,931
for that whole shebang bang, so if it's analytics, if it's SQL Server, if it's machine learning, real time,

6
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:39,931
that was me and my group and we produced something like 18 billion topics on a yearly basis.

7
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:47,931
You were looking at 60,000 page views a month. On average, I get 18 million page views over on SQL Server.

8
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:55,931
So why would I leave there to come to this room? And if any of you have not seen Ed Wilson's blog.

9
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,931
Why would you ask that question? I don't understand that.

10
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:58,931
It's a lead.

11
00:00:58,931 --> 00:00:59,931
I was confused.

12
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,931
It's a lead in.

13
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:02,931
Okay, just thought I'd make sure.

14
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:03,931
I mean, besides

15
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:09,931
the extra pay I mean always gets to work in PowerShell. So why would I leave that to come over here.

16
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:12,931
And here's the thing that is really motivating for me.

17
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:18,931
What am I more passionate about than a job title or a particular technology?

18
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:26,931
It's when I see a very active community that gives a crap about helping the person to their left,

19
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:32,931
that's willing to contribute their knowledge back to the betterment of the community as a whole.

20
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:39,931
Love that. I love it when we have a dev team that actually cares about the scenarios you're trying to do

21
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,931
and whether we can get them all done and do them cleanly. That's one thing.

22
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:50,931
It'll mature over time. But you put those two things together and you put all that goodness in an open framework

23
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,931
where you have the ability not just to help the person next to you,

24
00:01:54,931 --> 00:02:02,931
but help the person across the country, help the person that's just getting started, help fix a problem up in open source.

25
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:07,931
That's where things get really, really interesting, and to be honest, you can't move something like the data

26
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:16,931
platform over to a system like that, but you can take a language and you can take that platform, and you can

27
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:23,931
take this community and enable it to support each other. So I would encourage everyone to take a look at Ed Wilson's

28
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:28,931
blog from yesterday. I was a guest blogger there and we're talking about what's

29
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:33,931
the future of PowerShell documentation. The future of PowerShell documentation is actually sitting in this

30
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:39,931
room and listening to this video ultimately long term. We're going to go completely open source with our

31
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:45,931
documentation, which means you have access. If you see something that's bugging you, you can go fix it.

32
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:51,931
If there's a better way of explaining some a hard concept, you can help us help the person to your left.

33
00:02:51,931 --> 00:03:00,931
All of our documentation is going to be up on GitHub, very simple contribution requirements, but everything that

34
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,931
you do, you get credit for. Your names on that article, your picture's on that article.

35
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:06,931
If you're

36
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:12,931
promoting your personal portfolio and your persona, we're going to link out to your stuff all in an effort

37
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:18,931
to get us to a point where we take a look at some of the other open source languages like Python.

38
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:24,931
Now Python documentation is ugo. It is the way, it's like going back to 1985.

39
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:31,931
It looks horrible, but the content itself is exceptional. It's easy to discover.

40
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,931
They break the hard concepts down and there's not a bunch of paid writers sitting in a dark room somewhere

41
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:40,931
just cranking out words. It's the community going up there

42
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:45,931
hey there's a better way. Or don't forget you've got to remember these three things.

43
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:49,931
So we're kicking it off with DSC right now. There's a pilot going on.

44
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:56,931
JP who's one of my writers here. We've got another swath of content that's moving up into the open portfolio.

45
00:03:56,931 --> 00:04:01,931
We're actually going to be bringing core PowerShell as a reference, so as we talk about the shifts that are

46
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,931
going on in engineering,

47
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:04,931
documentation

48
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:09,931
has been doing the same thing. If you look at how many product teams that we work with that are producing

49
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:17,931
PowerShell, it went from 2 or 3 to I think our last count was 380 development teams at Microsoft are

50
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:22,931
contributing to PowerShell in some way, whether through modules or extensions.

51
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,931
To be able to operate at that speed, it can't just be the PowerShell team.

52
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:30,931
And it can't be just the four or five writers that I have on my team.

53
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:35,931
It's going to take a community to make this actually work and we're going to start that by investing and

54
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:41,931
opening it up, getting it out of the way of you guys helping and supporting each other and sharing that guidance.

55
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:48,931
So my name is Don Gill, my email address is the easiest one ever, dongill@microsoft.com or Twitter, you can always

56
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:53,931
hit me up if there's something wrong, there's something we should be doing better, I'm the guy that's going

57
00:04:53,931 --> 00:05:00,931
to help make it happen, whether it's on the online, whether it's in the shell itself, we can do this better.

58
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:01,931
Hit me up. Thank you.

59
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:02,931
Thank you.

60
00:05:02,931 --> 00:59:59,999
Yah, thank you much.
