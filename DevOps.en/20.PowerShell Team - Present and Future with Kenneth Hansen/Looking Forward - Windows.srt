1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,183
Alright, I think we can move on.

2
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:03,183
We're going to shift a little bit. Absolutely.

3
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:05,183
We have a guest speaker today

4
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:13,183
who's going to join us. How many of you know Erin? Yeah.

5
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:21,183
Erin is my boss, that's one thing and she also runs Windows Server completely and a few other things

6
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:24,183
as well, so she's going to tell us a little more about the future.

7
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:29,183
Awesome. It's great to be here. It's amazing to see from kind of coming

8
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:33,183
into this room, was it two years ago Don that I think we were here.

9
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,183
Three, two years ago.

10
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:35,183
Two years ago here.

11
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:42,183
Two years ago and just seeing the increase in folks that are seeing and interested in PowerShell,

12
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:47,183
interested in what we're doing in a DevOp space and here both learning from what we're putting out,

13
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:53,183
but also sharing the collective wisdom that's in this room. It's amazing to see.

14
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:58,183
As Kenneth said, I'm Erin Chaplin, the director of program management for the Windows Server team and I

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:04,183
thought I would just share a few top of mind things around what we're doing in Windows Server in particularly

16
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:10,183
how PowerShell and the whole DevOps experience fits into that. We're working, we're hard at work right now

17
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:15,183
on Windows Server 2016. Our technical preview for it came out late last year.

18
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:25,183
We're kind of on the eve of having a technical preview 5 that should be out later this month and that's kind of

19
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:34,183
our last big release before we'll hit like the final version of Windows Server that's due out later this year.

20
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:38,183
Windows Server is an interesting point, right, it's an interesting product and it's an interesting point in

21
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:44,183
the industry and just in general, right. We're at a transition period and when we think about Windows Server,

22
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:51,183
we really think about two roles that Windows Server plays. Traditionally, it's been very much part of the

23
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:56,183
infrastructure and that whole space and as we see the infrastructure and where that's moving,

24
00:01:56,183 --> 00:02:02,183
that's undergoing a lot of changes, particularly as we think about the whole transition to the cloud, right,

25
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:07,183
and I think one of the things for you to think about or have in context is when we think about the cloud,

26
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:13,183
we really, we don't think about kind of public cloud or private cloud or something, we think about cloud as a model, right.

27
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:18,183
And that's a big transition that we're going through just in terms of how do you deliver applications

28
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:24,183
and services in a more agile way and we haven't got it perfect yet, right, but we're working through that

29
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:31,183
transition as we think about where we go and how we help customers embrace that cloud model on whatever term

30
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:37,183
that they have. And Windows Server plays a key role of that because it fulfills the on-premises sort of

31
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:44,183
promise to customers of being able to stand up a cloud model and stand up their infrastructure on their terms.

32
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:51,183
And so, Windows Server is kind of part of the whole cloud ecosystem we would say either running it on-premises

33
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:56,183
in a data center running it, in some service provider, or Windows Server is actually the underpinnings of

34
00:02:56,183 --> 00:03:03,183
what the Azure cloud runs on top of, and so a lot of the work that you'll see with us in Windows Server 2016

35
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:08,183
that's coming out is focused very much on that cloud model and how are we the cloud-ready operating system.

36
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:14,183
What are we doing in terms of taking the learnings that we have from Azure and running kind of this public

37
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:19,183
cloud at very large hyper scale and then bringing that down and delivering it to customers to provide the

38
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:25,183
Fabric of the infrastructure within their environment. So huge investments we've made in the whole software

39
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:30,183
define space, so software define networking, really kind of providing that infrastructure

40
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:34,183
that allows you to have the portability of your applications and be able to move them right between different

41
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:41,183
clouds, between on-prem, between the public cloud, work that we're doing in the software define storage

42
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:48,183
space to really let you kind of get the power of software and the high resiliency that you've had and historically

43
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:53,183
through hardware, but delivered through software to lay as the foundation and then all the investments that

44
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:58,183
we're making kind of in the Hyper-V layer and the compute layer that go along with that.

45
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:04,183
One of the big things that I'll just kind of put because I think it's important in the context of this community

46
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:08,183
is a lot of the work that we're doing around assurance, right, and we know the world has changed from a

47
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:15,183
security point of view in just in terms of how people think about their operating environment and wanting

48
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:20,183
that assurance that what they're running in the Fabric and the infrastructure is secure.

49
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:27,183
We've done a lot of work in 2016 introducing a new set of functionality around shielded VMs and this ability

50
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:32,183
to really kind of encrypt using BitLocker your virtual machines that are running on top of the Fabric and

51
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:39,183
then have that, the Fabric tested in a way so that you can guarantee that the Fabric is the Fabric you want

52
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:43,183
it to be and that the VM won't boot. And a lot of these things where

53
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:47,183
we're thinking about, okay these things you maybe don't need to worry about when you're in a public cloud

54
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:51,183
environment, right, because you trust the provider or what not, but when you are wanting to stand up your own

55
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:58,183
infrastructure, they become super important for you to have. So we play a huge role in Windows Server just

56
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:04,183
around that infrastructure and how we're taking that forward and how we're helping organizations in a

57
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:09,183
modernized the underlying infrastructure that they have. The other part that's kind of super relevant to

58
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:14,183
this audience is the role that we play as an application platform, right.

59
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:17,183
Really you have an infrastructure. Why do you have an infrastructure?

60
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,183
It's to run virtual machines and the new world containers. Why do you have those?

61
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,183
It's to run applications.

62
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:27,183
And we really see that whole space is changing pretty dramatically, right.

63
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:35,183
If you went back and thought about how applications go from conception through to the deployment in an

64
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:39,183
environment 10 years ago, we're in a very, very different world right now.

65
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:44,183
That's why you're seeing kind of a lot of work that we're doing, particularly around PowerShell,

66
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:51,183
Desired State Configuration, but also then the ecosystem around that of Nano and the new installer work that

67
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:55,183
we're doing and contributing to the testing environment through things like Pester and all of those things as

68
00:05:55,183 --> 00:06:01,183
being super important to our strategy and we're trying to figure out how we modernize that as well and how do

69
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:05,183
we take a lot of the agile concepts and things that we're seeing more

70
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:11,183
in the OSS world and kind of Linux world and community of how people put together applications and how they

71
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:16,183
go and kind of get the packages they need, put them together, integrate them, have configuration as code,

72
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:23,183
do that in a kind of heterogeneous world and put that plumbing and that basis into what we provide from a

73
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:30,183
platform point of view for Windows Server. So 2016, there's a ton of stuff in it.

74
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:38,183
It is I would say the start of this pivot towards this more cloud model and how we're thinking about

75
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:45,183
taking it into and landing that transformation in organizations all the way from the infrastructure up to the

76
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:54,183
development space and we see PowerShell as being kind of in some sense a bit of the glue between those two worlds, right.

77
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:59,183
It has a lot of and when we initially developed PowerShell,

78
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:04,183
there was a lot of emphasis around it being a language and it having a lot of these properties that were really

79
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:09,183
important from a development space and if you have a development background, those things being things that

80
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:15,183
you come to expect and come to need in a scripting environment, etc.

81
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:22,183
But it also, we've done it and put a lot of our IT hat on it as we implemented it to make sure it was kind of

82
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:27,183
user friendly and it mapped into what you need to do from an IT infrastructure point of view.

83
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:32,183
And so we really do think it's positioned as being the glue between these two worlds and a lot of the

84
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:38,183
investments that you've probably had Kenneth and Angel talk about today are part of us thinking about how do

85
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:47,183
we evolve it and take it forward and have it be a showcase in our arsenal of tools in this new model, in this new

86
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:51,183
world as we think about really helping people embrace the cloud.

87
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:55,183
Again, whether or not that be public, whether or not that be on-premise or through a

88
00:07:55,183 --> 00:08:00,183
partner or trusted service provider. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of

89
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:07,183
context to kind of where we are in server, where we're going. It's a release that we're incredibly proud of

90
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:11,183
just in terms of the amount of innovation that I think that we're bringing to bear.

91
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:16,183
And so if you haven't checked it out, I would encourage you not only to check out the PowerShell and the kind

92
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:23,183
of WMF aspects of it, but also a bunch of the core investments that are going in the platform underneath both

93
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:30,183
from an IT infra-sight point of view, but also then as the next generation application platform when that's

94
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:36,183
really starting to be designed or optimized for more of that cloud first world.

95
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,183
So with that, I think I'll stop and yeah.

96
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:42,183
Awesome. We're looking forward to it. Nano's going to be a great one in Windows Server.

97
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,183
Nano, well I just want to say Nano and containers, right,

98
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,183
are pretty big in terms of the transformation that we're making.

99
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:53,183
I mean just seem odd where we talk about Nano and the impact it's going to have just for the size, for an automation,

100
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:58,183
for a performance, so definitely the role that PowerShell is going to play there like Erin says it's going to be significant.

101
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:03,183
We're going to need the help of our community to actually start taking some of the assisting cmdlets and

102
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:08,183
investments that we manuscript and you bring those down through Nano because we start thinking about

103
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:10,183
heterogeneous type of environments, but in management and

104
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:17,183
automation, if we want PowerShell to assist in investments that you have to be reused when managing Nano as well.

105
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:22,183
And simultaneously when the server, as we just talked about before, spans this broad spectrum of customers,

106
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:28,183
and so we're actually able to land you for those who are going a little slower than necessarily the Nano adoption,

107
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:35,183
so we really think 2016 is sort of began to both show the future and handle the past and kind of bring them a

108
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,183
little more together in a more cohesive way.

109
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:47,183
And so the last thing I can say is probably in a little bit of a request and an invitation, I would say,

110
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:54,183
and that is we're going through a transition. I think if you, it's an exciting time to be at Microsoft right now.

111
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:59,183
I've been there for almost 18 years and it's just the climate internally and just the

112
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:04,183
willingness for people to take a look at how we've done things in the past and really to go oh does that

113
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:10,183
really work, is that really what the world needs, is that really how we should interface externally, is just amazing.

114
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:16,183
And so, we are going through this transition. I think we don't have it all figured out, but I think we have

115
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:22,183
a pretty good idea based upon input from folks like yourself about what's needed and what the problem space is

116
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:27,183
and what could help and we're trying to do our best to kind of match, I would say, that input that we have with

117
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:32,183
what we put out. And so, it would be first kind of a request to have a little patience, right.

118
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:37,183
We're going through this journey and this transformation together and we're going to get hopefully more right

119
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,183
than wrong, but the good news is that we are increasing our frequency of getting things out there, and so we

120
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:49,183
can adjust as we go along. But we won't get it right unless we have the partnership with folks like you that

121
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:54,183
are in this room, and so please take advantage of the various different community organizations,

122
00:10:54,183 --> 00:11:00,183
the UserVoice site that we have, all of those pieces, in order to really channel your feedback in because I

123
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:07,183
will tell you if anything this is one of the teams that I think it takes that input more to heart than other

124
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:12,183
parts of the organization that have been less, more isolated in the past and like

125
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:17,183
it's a little bit more of a heavy lift for me to get the folks that are working on kind of core protocol level

126
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:23,183
stuff that they don't really have a community to interface with to go accept some piece of user input.

127
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:32,183
I think the PowerShell team has a reputation of listening to those things and have the kind of request that

128
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:39,183
we're not going to get it all right, but keep it coming because I think that only benefits both of us in the long run.

129
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:40,183
So thank you.

130
00:11:40,183 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you very much.
