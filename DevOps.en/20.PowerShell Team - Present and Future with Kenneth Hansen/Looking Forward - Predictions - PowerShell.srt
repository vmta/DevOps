1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,514
Well that was a good view of the future of Windows Server, but I think we want to talk a little bit about

2
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,514
looking forward at our predictions for PowerShell in the future.

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:16,514
We can't have a looking forward discussion without some random predictions, so we have to.

4
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:22,514
Disclaimer, we are not architects like Jeffrey. These are predictions that I feel pretty good that I think

5
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:23,514
that we can achieve.

6
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:27,514
Well kind of in an order of like achievable to aspirational.

7
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:33,514
Exactly. So I feel pretty good about kind of our predictions, so I've got to bet, I would bet in our predictions---

8
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:35,514
I'm confident of that one.

9
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:41,514
I'm pretty confident about this one. So as Erin mentioned earlier, Windows Server 2016 is coming up

10
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:47,514
and it will be available sometime this year. And with that, we will release a WMF 5.1 update that will

11
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:56,514
contain all the changes from WMF 5.0 all the way through that what we call RTM release, so it will accumulate

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,514
those changes, yeah, whatever

13
00:00:57,514 --> 00:01:01,514
we end up calling it, whatever marketing is used. GA I think is was we call it nowadays.

14
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:02,514
I think so, yes.

15
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:09,514
So GA will accumulate all the fixes and we'll re-release to help you take the latest changes.

16
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:11,514
One thing that's really important, it goes back to the feedback.

17
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:16,514
Please give us the feedback because this is the opportunity if there are some bugs, issues,

18
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:22,514
suggestions that you want us to consider that is this interesting time between now and then, they can help

19
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:25,514
you to get those changes and bug fixes into the WMF 5.1.

20
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:30,514
And the goal of this release of 5.1 is a little more of a service pack type of thing, if you will,

21
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:38,514
because in fact it will be the way that we support 5.0 moving forward, so we already put WMF 5.0 out there.

22
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:43,514
We'll be making the usually Microsoft support issues whatever it is with it all that we normally don't have

23
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:49,514
that many QFEs out of PowerShell, still we would do those kind of things, but we roll up any and all changes

24
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:55,514
into 5.1 and that's how we would actually support the 5.0 after that and then we'll be making changes on the

25
00:01:55,514 --> 00:02:02,514
5.1 base and you'll get the usual Microsoft contract on 5.1, which would be required then like 3 or 4 months

26
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:06,514
after we put out 5.1. We'll do whatever sort of makes sense in that space.

27
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:13,514
Will those updates be released as KBs? We're still in discussion to figure out exactly how those will also be released.

28
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:16,514
That's a great, yeah. So we'll keep looking into that.

29
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:20,514
That's a good question by the way. That's actually we are going through that, internalizing that right now.

30
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,514
But this is a, anyway I just want to make sure people have got their head out, they know we've got a lot of

31
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:28,514
done with 5.0. We didn't want people to be surprised. We said oh by the way, now you need to roll to the 5.1

32
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:35,514
in order to continue forward as it will align with the Windows Server release and all the support alignment

33
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:40,514
with a Windows Server product, if that makes sense. And we'll blog about that later.

34
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:41,514
Oh, this one!

35
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:46,514
Yeah, OpenSSH. So OpenSSH is an open source project by the way.

36
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:50,514
It's already available for many of you. Please feel free to contribute.

37
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:56,514
We'll keep updating it. We will release an OpenSSH in Windows 2016.

38
00:02:56,514 --> 00:03:00,514
It will be available. It will be just to give you visibility will be first of all.

39
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,514
It's not going to be perfect.

40
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,514
Oh no, nothing is perfect in software, but I'm sure we can make it awesome.

41
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,514
It's going to be great.

42
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:12,514
But I think the point here is that initial, just to set expectation, it will be kind of like WMF.

43
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:16,514
It would be what we call an autobahn, so it will be a package that we'll make available for you in the gallery

44
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:20,514
that you can install it. It will be supported. And then over time where one of the things that we are

45
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:25,514
considering is actually bring as part of Windows and install, but we need because we want to get some of the

46
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:29,514
feedback from you and from the community from using it and then we'll continue improving it.

47
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:32,514
We are working very closely with the OpenDSD community, as well.

48
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:36,514
They are helping us, especially about together the crypto security of

49
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:41,514
Windows with OpenSSH, which is really what we are spending most of time.

50
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:45,514
And we're really excited about this project because I think it's going to help us a lot in the enterprise.

51
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:49,514
This is a pick by many of you and by many other people who are not here today.

52
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:55,514
That's right. A lot of fun. Oh and this one. We are continuing to invest in security and breach.

53
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:58,514
I think Erin highlighted that a little bit. That hasn't gone away.

54
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:04,514
It's only become more important to us and to our customers. Even as a part of that, from our perspective in

55
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:09,514
security, it also goes back to some of the quality issues. We continually are asked hey we want the gallery

56
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:14,514
to be the place to go for high quality stuff. Security also is kind of related to that.

57
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:20,514
We're going to continue to focus on security and quality on a regular basis.

58
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:23,514
One thing just to point out, I mean, this is a really important area for investing.

59
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:28,514
How many of you know Lee Holmes? Okay, so Lee Holmes' role is changing.

60
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:32,514
Recently, we made an announcement internally in the company. He's going to be our lead architect for

61
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:37,514
security for Enterprise Cloud because we start realizing we need to start thinking about security,

62
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:43,514
not necessarily just within PowerShell, but when you take PowerShell and you put it in the cloud, how are we

63
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:48,514
going to be thinking about protecting, doing things like assume breach, and that sort of scenario.

64
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:53,514
So that tells you that we are really behind the security efforts.

65
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:57,514
It definitely is the top of mind for the company for us.

66
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,514
And it's kind of cool you came out of PowerShell.

67
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,514
Yeah.

68
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:04,514
For all the security, you might remember our very first PowerShell don't turn on remoting because of

69
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:08,514
the supposed exploit. And

70
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:17,514
documentation. How many people would like documentation? And here to make sure that in fact you get that,

71
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:24,514
where's Don? Right here. Don, please give us, stand up and give us just a few minutes if you will.

72
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:27,514
So I didn't realize that the tail end of that was bet Don's job.

73
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:31,514
That's right. I didn't warn him I was going to put that on the slide.

74
00:05:31,514 --> 00:59:59,999
So not only was it this Don, but it was the Don that just came up.
