1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,757
Alright. Enough of the distant past. Moving to the past year.

2
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:09,757
So what an amazing year. I mean we made a lot of changes in PowerShell.

3
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:14,757
And really the PowerShell ecosystem and the technologies, I mean we, one of the things that probably you are

4
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:19,757
obviously very familiar as the work that we do in Windows and Windows Server and you know it started only

5
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:24,757
last year, there was a number of technical previews that we have released.

6
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:30,757
It's through those technical previews we have released as well multiple WMF previews and it was an extraordinary

7
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:34,757
journey for us because we learned tons and we're going to talk a little bit more about that.

8
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:40,757
But actually we want to highlight that while we're still releasing WMF to each of you in a frequently basis,

9
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:44,757
we've also been releasing management technologies in Windows and Windows Server.

10
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:50,757
And in a couple of weeks, we're going to be launching the technical preview 5 Windows Server 2016.

11
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:56,757
You're going to see some additional innovation that we are planning to release for both PowerShell and DSC.

12
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:57,757
And talking about WMF 5,

13
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:04,757
I can't resist, how's that for a download list. That's probably the fastest adoption I've ever seen of

14
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:10,757
Windows Management Framework, and in fact, it's going, we don't actually have the next week there.

15
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:15,757
We actually just finished week six and it keeps accelerating. So certainly, we've got people interested.

16
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:20,757
They're landing it and just to point to the final PS resistance,

17
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:29,757
that's what's in it. That's a carefully curated list and we expect there will be a test on it somewhere at

18
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:34,757
the end of the summit to make sure we've covered all possible capabilities.

19
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:37,757
You know, there's a lot there. There's a lot to tell people about.

20
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:40,757
There's a lot to speak to.

21
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:47,757
And you know the area that I think that, well recently, about a month ago we released the PowerShell gallery.

22
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:48,757
How many of you are using the PowerShell

23
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:55,757
gallery today? I mean, wow. This is pretty awesome. We had this vision back about a year ago about creating

24
00:01:55,757 --> 00:02:03,757
a repository, public repository for all of our community to come to basically share and make available resources

25
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:08,757
to help us just adopting some of the new features of PowerShell and one of things that we learned when we did

26
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:13,757
the launch, I mean look at the downloads per month. It's quite remarkable.

27
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:16,757
I mean, right now is one of the faster galleries that we have in Microsoft.

28
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,757
I think of the number right now. How many downloads we have so far?

29
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:20,757
About 1.3 million.

30
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:26,757
One point three million downloads of PowerShell artifacts I have already have occurred in the gallery.

31
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:33,757
Now as we talk through that a little bit, there is something worth noting, so the caveat, and that's that

32
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:38,757
although there's, I think this month we had almost 450,000 downloads, so it continues to accelerate rapidly.

33
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:48,757
Some of those do come from the Azure RM profile, and so there's kind of, right, about 150,000 over the last 6 weeks.

34
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:56,757
On the other hand, 150, the 450, probably 500,000, 600,000 in the past 6 weeks minus 150,000 is still a hell

35
00:02:56,757 --> 00:03:04,757
of a lot of downloads. So absolutely amazing ramp up, in spite of the actual sort of thing.

36
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:10,757
We'll work with Azure to make sure the numbers get a little crisper, but it's been a phenomenal adoption.

37
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:17,757
One thing that you heard probably earlier today from Neema, the product manager who presented the Nano coverage,

38
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:23,757
is that the effort that we have made in PowerShell to also read faster PowerShell for the full CLR dependency

39
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:30,757
to a core CLR dependency. This was something that was really important and in order to bring together a lighter,

40
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:36,757
a smaller version of the OS. You make a high performance. When you're looking at the numbers, they aren't showing

41
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:42,757
in that graph. They intend to actually show you kind of the impact that we have.

42
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:46,757
In delivering the PowerShell, there's going to lean, it's going to be faster, and it's going to actually start

43
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:53,757
moving towards to a more CoreCLR dependency in the future. I think this is really important as we start

44
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:57,757
building the new server in Nano, so here that's something to highlight.

45
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:05,757
Open source. We have been moving about as fast as we can within the resource constraints we have and the

46
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:13,757
business constraints we have to go to open source. That journey just started and already we've actually got

47
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,757
a ton of opportunity, certainly the gallery is certainly one thing.

48
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:22,757
At that gallery, it's where we sometimes forget that we just launched this gallery in like April, May.

49
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:28,757
It was just like almost a year ago, 2015. It's not very old. We're certainly out of the preview mode and

50
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,757
people are using it in production all the time, so it's a great thing.

51
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:36,757
We've also got the Script Analyzer, a bunch of editor services, the Visual Studio Code, and of course,

52
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,757
the OpenSSH, which we're looking forward to.

53
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:43,757
To making available. We'll talk a little bit more in the future about that.

54
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:48,757
We want to thank each of you because I know that many of you in this room, the other people who are going to

55
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:54,757
be watching this, they really have helped the team, engineering team, in particular, about just start

56
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:59,757
evolving ourselves into this open source culture.

57
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:05,757
So an interesting story is even before, we had just finished putting the gallery up and we hadn't yet made it public.

58
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:12,757
We hadn't told anybody. We had just put it up there, no it wasn't in preview, it was just they didn't tell

59
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:19,757
anybody it was up there and we were going to announce it the next day, and within hours, we got 600 lines of

60
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:24,757
submission of poll request that actually go would you please take these in.

61
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,757
How the hell did they find it and now they decide they're going to just?

62
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:33,757
This guy must have been waiting for this. Oh my gosh. Oh, they did it and just landed on it.

63
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:38,757
Within a few minutes after that, we got back to him and said oh could you make this tweak to your code and

64
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:42,757
then we'll take it and he did minutes later. So just a great, it's been a great experience.

65
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:46,757
Thank you very much for your overall support of that effort and of all of our efforts.

66
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:47,757
We cannot do it without you.

67
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:53,757
And especially we want to thank some people for their contributions because we've got some names here of

68
00:05:53,757 --> 00:06:00,757
people who really had an impact in our community on and delivering value into our open source projects.

69
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:08,757
We have Iain Brighton and our thanks for the Hyper-VM, the DNS, ActiveDirectory, and DHCPServer,

70
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:14,757
some great effort and work there. We really appreciate him. Aleksandar Nikolic for all the documentation.

71
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:20,757
Boy, open documentation. Thank you. Very useful and helpful. Everybody cares about that.

72
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:24,757
Keith Hill. I know I've got a Keith Hill here. Don't I have a Keith Hill?

73
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:29,757
He's been around? No. Did I see him? I didn't see him. Alright, I know what I don't know.

74
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:36,757
Apparently, he's not here. Clint Branham. We have a Clint. And Daniel Scott-Raynsford.

75
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:42,757
These guys have really done a great job and we just want to say thank you publicly here, and of course,

76
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:46,757
we'll say thank you to them also in person for their great effort.

77
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:51,757
And this will continue. Every while we'll say thanks to a few key contributors across our community who have

78
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:52,757
really helped us move forward.

79
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:59,757
And I think, are we giving something away for the contributors? We are, yeah.

80
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:03,757
Well these people in this particular case, Michael Green, if they are here, they can just see him.

81
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:11,757
Michael Green has for them $15,000 worth of Azure money useful for one month.

82
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:15,757
So one free month, that's a subscription to Azure.

83
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:18,757
So basically, one month unlimited almost.

84
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:19,757
Almost, depend on the usage. A lot.

85
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,757
Depending on what you use.

86
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:22,757
That's a lot.

87
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:26,757
So it's a substantial amount. We really do want to say thanks. Our appreciation, not just to them, but to every

88
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:30,757
single one of you who have contributed over time. If we could do it, we'd give it to everybody who

89
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:31,757
contributed any code.

90
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:32,757
Absolutely.

91
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:35,757
Well we thank you. We really appreciate it. One more hand for these guys who contributed,

92
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:36,757
even though they're not there.

93
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:42,757
Thank you.

94
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:45,757
Our thanks. Oh, the home page.

95
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,757
The home page.

96
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,757
We released the home page last year.

97
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:52,757
Yeah, last year again. Last year a side project out of Joey, Neema, and a few others.

98
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:56,757
They've done a great job. Okay, how many people have actually been to the PowerShell home page?

99
00:07:56,757 --> 00:08:03,757
Wahoo! Not that many. It's worth going to. It's not that hard to find.

100
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:10,757
It's microsoft.com/powershell, so you can find it pretty easily.

101
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:16,757
It is where we'll probably start driving a little more traffic. Even right now, of course, we have I

102
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:24,757
know 60,000 I guess home page visits here in this past month or so, which is not huge for our traffic,

103
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:30,757
but it's a substantial. The key is we'll start probably putting more announcements actually on the home page

104
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:35,757
and then blogging almost directly referring to that. So as we'll start doing stuff, it'll start coming up,

105
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:39,757
we'll start doing the advertisements, we'll start talking about maybe PowerShell around the world as we

106
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:46,757
started doing any celebration stuff for the 10-year exact date anniversary, we probably will put it up there

107
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:50,757
first and then we'll blog about it and that will enable us to actually to shift our blog a little bit,

108
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:55,757
and I'll talk about it a little later, to a little more chatty, a little less formal tone, a little more the

109
00:08:55,757 --> 00:09:03,757
formal stuff up on the home page, but it's well worth your perusal and occasional look at.

110
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:08,757
And if there's things that you think ought to be there that are not, feel free to tell us and I think it's

111
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,757
even worth a UserVoice. Feel free to actually put it on UserVoice if you want to.

112
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:15,757
It's just a way to actually communicate with us.

113
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:21,757
And then we're just going to I'm just going to go very quick about other things that we delivered last year,

114
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:26,757
well, actually even within the last few months. Right, you know one of the things that we've been doing,

115
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:31,757
it started with Lee Holmes with JEA. How many of you are using JEA today in your enterprises?

116
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,757
The few, the brave.

117
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:41,757
I highly encourage to really look in JEA as a vehicle to really think about security and protection in your environment.

118
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:47,757
Definitely one thing too that we are doing is the editing piece and as well as some encrypting MOFs.

119
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:50,757
I think that this is something that is becoming more and more important.

120
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,757
One of the things that we are learning with security is that PowerShell is becoming quite popular and you'll

121
00:09:55,757 --> 00:10:00,757
probably start seeing in the news, actually today there was a new article about DSC,

122
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:01,757
in Hacker News,

123
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:05,757
yeah in Hacker News and we're going to start seeing more and more of this.

124
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:11,757
It's fantastic that we see the popularity and the send time, this creates obviously a challenge for all of us

125
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:16,757
about how we start protecting PowerShell in investments and implementation in the enterprise.

126
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:20,757
So this is just in a starting point of what we're going to be doing in the future and you're going to start

127
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:25,757
seeing a lot more and more security focus, but here's to highlight some of the things that we have released so far.

128
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,757
Now there's a thing coming in the next 5.1 update.

129
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:35,757
Yeah. There's this concept about assume breach that we are focusing as well, so we'll talk a little bit more about later.

130
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:40,757
And the PowerShell support and DSC integration for the OMS automation.

131
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:45,757
I think that was, I don't know, how many of you know about Azure automation?

132
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:50,757
Okay. So one of the things that, thank you, one of the things that we learned with Azure automation is that

133
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:56,757
when we introduced the integration of native PowerShell and DSC, we saw an incredible adoption and I think it

134
00:10:56,757 --> 00:11:02,757
like about 25% of people in Azure automation today they are using some shape or form of DSC and I think that

135
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:06,757
this is an important thing to highlight because one of the things that we are learning now with PowerShell is

136
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:10,757
that we want to start integrating more and more into the cloud. It's starting to provide more of an extra

137
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:17,757
service for our customers and the community. DSC Linux.

138
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:20,757
It's been great because they finally put it out on the, I think, the open source code actually got it in

139
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:24,757
December 2015, so we're sort of starting down there. This is another good path for us.

140
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:31,757
We are going to slowly, but surely as we know try to give PowerShell technologies so you can use them where

141
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:36,757
you need to. Overall, and I think DSC on Linux is the first kind of effort, sort of get our feet wet,

142
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:42,757
and sort of understand what that process looks like, so we're really excited about that effort and hope it moves forward.

143
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:47,757
I think over time trying to consolidate. Right now, they're two separate code bases.

144
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:48,757
I think we're going to bring the code bases together and that is the plan.

145
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:53,757
And over time want to bring them together so the Windows and the Linux code base would perhaps be the same.

146
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:57,757
That'll take us a little bit of time to do that though and some shifts, just work with us.

147
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:04,757
One of the advantages of doing stuff open is everybody sort of gets to see it and use it early.

148
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:11,757
One of the disadvantages is everybody gets to see it and use it early and stuff changes a little bit,

149
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:17,757
and so we're going to try to be a little more directional, I think, in our communication, in our guide and

150
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:20,757
say look here's how we're, we'll be a little more open about here's where we're going with this,

151
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:24,757
here's what we're doing on this source project, and work through both the RFC process. and we'll cover that a

152
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:28,757
little more later, but just get your heads up. This is one of the great things.

153
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,757
One of the other things we sort of skipped by is the Azure Extension Handler.

154
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:34,757
We've had some pretty good traction with that right now with here right now where, of course,

155
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:39,757
you can automatically do DSC, get stuff uploaded, downloaded, create your Azure VMs a lot more easily than

156
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,757
you could before.

157
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:47,757
Yeah, I think we are planning to continue updating the Azure Extension Handler with additional modules as

158
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:52,757
well with this configuration and yeah. And so that's something that is going to be a continued this point moving forward.

159
00:12:52,757 --> 00:13:00,757
And then finally, the DSC integration with Chef, in particular, but as well as with Ansible.

160
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:07,757
You know actually we should really thank Steve because Steve has done a lot of work to really take the power

161
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:13,757
of DSC as a platform and really start to integrate it with Chef and I figured that was an amazing collaboration,

162
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:14,757
so thank you for doing that.

163
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,757
That's great.

164
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:21,757
I'm expecting a t-shirt by the way. Looking forward for the t-shirt.

165
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:24,757
And we also worked with others, so we can't only love him.

166
00:13:24,757 --> 00:13:29,757
No. When you build a platform, we have an awful lot of people.

167
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:33,757
You can have preference, but at the end of the day, we are building a platform and I think that this is

168
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:37,757
something that I think you're going to start seeing a lot more continuity is how we start basically

169
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:43,757
integrating the platform with other open source projects. This is something that we're going to be doing

170
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:44,757
more and more.

171
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,757
And we appreciate anybody who layers tools over the platform that we have, we'll have to do some,

172
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,757
but God bless the ISEs and tooling.

173
00:13:50,757 --> 00:59:59,999
Yes.
