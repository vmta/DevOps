00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:19,19
Good afternoon. You know, normally, what you have seen in the past is that Jeffrey Snover tends to be here

2
00:00:19,19 --> 00:00:24,24
to talk a little bit about the future, but this time Jeffrey's on a trip.

3
00:00:24,24 --> 00:00:29,29
He's in Hawaii somewhere taking a vacation. Can you believe it? But anyway, so Kenneth and I, we're going to

4
00:00:29,29 --> 00:00:34,34
spend a little time today talk about the past, the present, and the future of PowerShell.

5
00:00:34,34 --> 00:00:40,40
For all of you guys who don't know me, my name is Angel Calvo. I'm the partner group software engineering

6
00:00:40,40 --> 00:00:46,46
manager for Enterprise Cloud Management. My team is the team responsible for the management technologies for

7
00:00:46,46 --> 00:00:50,50
Windows, as well as PowerShell, Desired State Configuration.

8
00:00:50,50 --> 00:00:59,59
Ken Hansen and I guess I've been on the PowerShell team for 13 years, a very long time.

9
00:00:59,59 --> 00:01:05,65
Turn the mic on. Who didn't turn that on? Is that working? Yes.

10
00:01:05,65 --> 00:01:14,74
I'm Ken Hansen and I don't know how to work these mics, but I do PowerShell for about 13 years,

11
00:01:14,74 --> 00:01:19,79
so that's---I need a command. Where's the command turn on mic? Alright, good deal.

12
00:01:19,79 --> 00:01:20,80
That's it.

13
00:01:20,80 --> 00:01:22,82
So let's talk a little bit about PowerShell.

14
00:01:22,82 --> 00:01:29,89
This is great. So it's 10 years, 2006-2016 and I couldn't resist putting up the actual original book that

15
00:01:29,89 --> 00:01:36,96
came out with Monad. Anybody remember MSH and Monad? How many Monads do we have here?

16
00:01:36,96 --> 00:01:39,99
Thank you very much. You guys have been with us a long time. It's been a fun journey.

17
00:01:39,99 --> 00:01:41,101
I just couldn't resist.

18
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,105
Lee Holmes actually had it on his desk just so you know where that photo shot came from.

19
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,110
It's kind of a fun little thing. We thank you for your great support.

20
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,115
Our mission we actually started with a while ago and this is a great one almost worth reading.

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:02:06,126
Deliver an extensible scripting environment that is secure, interactive, programmable, production-ready,

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:14,134
that's a lot, to enable consistent, now you're getting really out there, consistent and reliable automation

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:20,140
of administration tasks. What's fascinating is, we're not there yet, but we're going to do our job eventually.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
Yeah, we are.

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,145
Alright. The good news is we've had 10 years of progress. With your help, we made great strides,

26
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
but there's a lot to do.

27
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,150
In 10 years, I mean this year, November?

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
November 14th.

29
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:36,156
November 14th, 10 years of PowerShell. I mean it is quite an amazing journey for all of us,

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,160
especially for all of you who been since day 1.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
A few gray hairs to prove it.

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:47,167
And actually, the community, I mean what an amazing community. By the way, how many of you started using

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,169
PowerShell 10 years ago?

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:57,177
Isn't that amazing? Give these guys a hand. This has absolutely been a phenomenal journey.

35
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,182
It's these people who together with the rest of the community made PowerShell what it is today.

36
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:07,187
I mean this was known not only at Microsoft a journey, it was a journey that we took with all of you,

37
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:12,192
so we really appreciate it. You help to get us to what we are today.

38
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:18,198
Oh, and to make a point to that, these are about 80 names, I think it's 81.

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,203
These are actually people, the community, not members of Microsoft, these are all community members who filed

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:31,211
bugs in the year 2004 on PowerShell at the time. Isn't that an incredible list?

41
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,214
Eighty people. From the very beginning, it's been a community effort and one thing I couldn't resist because

42
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:39,219
we did miss this, we're going back in slides, a complete no, no, but I can't resist.

43
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,224
Right there at the bottom right-hand side, if you want to, for those of you who are archeologists and you

44
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,227
want to go see the original BNF, go see Jim Truher. He's actually got it.

45
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:52,232
It's kind of fun. And Lee Holmes actually had at one point a VM running the old PowerShell.

46
00:03:52,232 --> 00:59:59,999
Just wanted to point that out. It's kind of a fun thing to have.
