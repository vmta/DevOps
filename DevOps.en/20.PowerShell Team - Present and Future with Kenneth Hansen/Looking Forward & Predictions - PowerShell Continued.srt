1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,951
Yeah, yes.

2
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:07,951
We can't resist. Now we're into the more fun predictions. We always have, we've always believed in

3
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:13,951
PowerShell and in audit, it's PowerShell or no UI, it's UI or no PowerShell.

4
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:18,951
We've always believed the worlds that peanut butter and chocolate work better together, unless you're allergic

5
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:24,951
to peanuts, but that's not the problem. So what we're trying to say here is that over time we want to make

6
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:31,951
sure we have great UI over PowerShell. And so, we've actually plumbed a few things, but we will get

7
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:37,951
seriously considering, notice the word consider, it's might caveat.

8
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:38,951
Seriously.

9
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:44,951
But seriously, find some way to actually auto-generate UI out of PowerShell modules.

10
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,951
Yeah, awesome.

11
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:52,951
It might not be the prettiest, but it should be sufficient and then hopefully we're even looking at ways for

12
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,951
you then to be able to do curate a UI on top of that. It's an interesting project.

13
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:06,951
A few people told us we were crazy and that we would fail, but we're having a lot of fun and we are somewhat confident.

14
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:16,951
Community. I think, we've been talking a lot about community and definitely the future of PowerShell is the community.

15
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:22,951
It's all of us. It's the people here, the people who is basically around the planet using PowerShell every day

16
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:29,951
and I think as we start thinking about communication, like how we're going to work together, we want you to

17
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:35,951
be a significant part of the future of PowerShell. We are introducing an RFC process.

18
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:39,951
I believe in the MVP summit for all of you who are MVPs, you got a preview of that.

19
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:44,951
But this is something that we want more and more. PowerShell file.

20
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:49,951
We've done amazing stuff together. We're going to continue investing in PowerShell when it comes to

21
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:55,951
integrating into Windows, integrating with some of the Microsoft technologies, but there's this other aspect

22
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:02,951
about you are the expert in PowerShell. We need your help. So if you have ideas, if you want to request

23
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:06,951
changes, design, we want to provide you a vehicle to do that.

24
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,951
UserVoice, that kind of stuff.

25
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,951
Absolutely. And the RFC process, as well, right.

26
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:12,951
Absolutely.

27
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:16,951
And the other thing too about the GitHub, I think that this is another thing, GitHub will begin our official

28
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:22,951
place where we want our communities to work together and you're going to start seeing a lot more and more of

29
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,951
GitHub open source projects. A lot more.

30
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,951
We just started.

31
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:32,951
This is just the starting of what is coming next and we want that to be absolutely the repository for all of us,

32
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:39,951
for you to start sharing and we're going to start providing, how many of you know Joey?

33
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:45,951
Joey's somewhere in the back. He's what I call our community problem manager, it's the best description,

34
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:51,951
and he's working right now in our government about how we're going to be doing these, how it's going to help

35
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,951
the community to work together about sharing artifacts and technology moving forward.

36
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:00,951
Yeah, and I don't want to hit, I know we've hit the community a lot and open stuff, so I won't belabor it anymore.

37
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:04,951
The one thing worth noting is over time PowerShell gallery will continue to become a more and more trusted

38
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,951
distribution surface for many things, possibly and besides just PowerShell artifacts, but certainly for

39
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:16,951
PowerShell artifacts both from inside of those which we produce as Microsoft, but also we're trying to find

40
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:21,951
ways where if another company produced an artifact that you know it's supported and validated,

41
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:27,951
it's actually from them, that kind of stuff. So we're trying to make sure that it is a trusted place or at

42
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,951
the least you know which modules are highly trusted you can go download and use and we'll continue to grow

43
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:37,951
that over time. It is something that Microsoft all up is sort of beginning to learn and get their head around.

44
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:42,951
We are in many ways the PowerShell team has been a great place to work at, I kind of stepped back a little bit,

45
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:46,951
and a horrible place. It's been great because we always get to do something new and crazy.

46
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:51,951
It's been horrible because everybody looks around and says what are you doing and then we have to sort of

47
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,951
fight our way free of the entanglements that come with the past.

48
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:59,951
But that's another case where we kind of stood out there and we started stood it up and you've guys have been really

49
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:04,951
supportive, that's really helped us get the message out and more teams are looking at it going hey we could

50
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:08,951
use something like this, and so we're working with them. Some of that is artifacts might show up here,

51
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,951
some might show up somewhere else, but thank you again for your help.

52
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,951
But this should become a trusted place to go.

53
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:16,951
Yep. And I think in the open source, so just to point out a couple of things.

54
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:21,951
One of the things there we highlighted earlier was the concept of how we started using our platform to

55
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:26,951
integrate into open source technologies like Chef. And I think that you're going to start seeing this trend

56
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:32,951
should become more and more broad. I mean, the goal, I mean, the dream for some of us is imagine the day

57
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,951
that no matter what language that you use to actually build your application.

58
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,951
You can use PowerShell and DSC as the automation language, the utility language, if you will,

59
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:45,951
and the configuration method for actually deploy your application in the cloud and manage it in the cloud.

60
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,951
I mean that is the dream. That's what we want to get to. I mean, how we're going to do that is by doing this

61
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:54,951
level of integration with a number of technologies that are available today in the open source community.

62
00:04:54,951 --> 00:05:02,951
And just a couple of more predictions here moving forward, one, now this is kind of a different one than the others.

63
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:07,951
This is where we're actually just beginning. We're going to use a lot more telemetry and metrics of success

64
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:12,951
across our team. How do I know we've had a good community engagement?

65
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:15,951
I'm going to have some statistic that I try to get some sense on it.

66
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:20,951
Now that's not the only way we'll do things and the only way we'll measure success, but we would love to

67
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:28,951
engage with those of you who are crazy statisticians and have some ideas as to how we can measure your guy's

68
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:32,951
success because one of the things I do struggle with is I don't just care about our success, okay I've got

69
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:38,951
tons of downloads, but I'd also love to reach pass that a little bit and say, okay, how do I know that my

70
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:45,951
community has been successful in deployment? How do I know that people are not stuck on something?

71
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:55,951
How do I know that the corporation received great value from the PowerShell, their use of PowerShell or DSC?

72
00:05:55,951 --> 00:06:00,951
How do I measure the fact that DSC actually, in some cases, it's easy.

73
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:06,951
Well DSC reduced my deployment and reconfiguration time from a week to three hours.

74
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:12,951
Okay, that's a great measurement. Anything like that you can give us or any other ideas you have around that,

75
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,951
please feed them in because it's really more of a request for information this one is as a prediction

76
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:22,951
because we're going to do something here, it be great to have it actually be great.

77
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:30,951
Micro-services. I think that this is a, you probably got a taste of that with OMS Azure automation with our DSC integration.

78
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:36,951
In reality, that's a pull server that we have basically deployed into the cloud using Azure.

79
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:40,951
Yeah I think one of the things that which they're seeing is more and more of an investment in our platform

80
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:45,951
than this one should just deliver in the platform. We're going to start delivering services that you can

81
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:51,951
actually use for doing things like, David communicated yesterday in a presentation, editor services.

82
00:06:51,951 --> 00:07:00,951
How can I plug in my favorite editor in order to do PowerShell? How can I basically do validation of my

83
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:05,951
scripting into the cloud, so I can have it hosted validation services, maybe Pester is a service,

84
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:12,951
think about it that way. Configuration. DSC is a platform, well what is configuration as a service?

85
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:14,951
Things like pull server.

86
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:19,951
Pull server's been a big one. We just had a whole discussion around pull server and it's a great little

87
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:22,951
product, in fact, we put it out there first originally, more as a sample.

88
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:27,951
We sort of backed into it a little bit. It's like hey we got this platform, we got this LCM, how do we make

89
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:31,951
sure you can actually use it in pull mode. Oh, we'll write a little piece of code to make sure it works.

90
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,951
Okay, well that's a good, we need to make it a bigger piece of code. Let's make sure

91
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:39,951
we actually have a good sample out there. Oh, okay let's take the next step.

92
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:44,951
Let's actually oh people might want to use that sample as a test case, and over time, we've grown this thing

93
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:50,951
to actually be something that Azure put out there with the intent that people would actually write larger

94
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,951
tools and more complete tools on top of the basic underlying protocol.

95
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:58,951
What we discovered is everybody says oh I want a pull server and starts using it automatically.

96
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,951
They exceeded our expectations.

97
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:07,951
Our adoption and the speed of adoption certainly exceeded our original expectation, which is great and

98
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:12,951
certainly we're stepping back and saying okay how do we fill that need in a way that will meet the overall business

99
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,951
objectives, but also just meet the community's. And so we're thinking through how to do that in a way again

100
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:23,951
that would be open and thoughtful and bring everybody in and let us create a great experience instead of

101
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,951
one right now, which needs some improvement. We're going to keep working on it.

102
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:31,951
If you're hitting roadblocks in the pull server, file those, tell us, and work with us in the future.

103
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:39,951
I think it's really important too that the role of micro-services in the hybrid scenarios, it just kind of

104
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:45,951
goes to the point that Erin made earlier, is we start thinking about heterogeneous, we start thinking gross cloud

105
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:49,951
type of integration. It's really important having the sort of services that allows you to do both.

106
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:54,951
You can be on-prem, but if you want to go to the cloud, it allows you to easily integrate with other types

107
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,951
of cloud services. So I think this is a scenario, especially like deployment it would be a good example of

108
00:08:58,951 --> 00:08:59,951
that as well.

109
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:03,951
Absolutely. And another place is where this does pivot us a little bit towards, as Angel was talking about

110
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:08,951
the scenarios and solutions, we will pivot. We're a platform as you mentioned in that other meeting,

111
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:14,951
we're a platform first and foremost and we want to make sure people succeed and we'll probably start picking

112
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:15,951
a couple of vertical

113
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:18,951
places of like deployment or something like that. Make sure okay you can really get the bits out there,

114
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:23,951
they're really going to be successful and have an all up solution with the package manager, DSC,

115
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:26,951
PowerShell all combined together.

116
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:32,951
And I think another thing that's about a good reason why I think the name of the summit has changed.

117
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:37,951
I mean, I think it was a year ago, Don and I, and a few others, Jeff and we were having this idea about how

118
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:43,951
we evolve it, how the summit will evolve and I think Don came up it's like well you guys got to think about

119
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,951
these DevOps then, right. We were like looking at each other like yeah I guess this is for real.

120
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:53,951
It's really a culture shift in IT. And we realized that wow there is this amazing opportunity for PowerShell

121
00:09:53,951 --> 00:10:01,951
to become the language that basically ties things together and the concept of both the tool, if you will,

122
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:07,951
chain of DevOps, as well as, as people start evolving and moving the solutions that you want agile deployment

123
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:13,951
and operations of those solutions, PowerShell and DSC can play a significant role of that.

124
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:17,951
So I think that moving into the future, this is a scenario that we're going to be investing more and more,

125
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,951
and we're going to be working with our community of tying that to a chain all of us together.

126
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,951
And this is kind of the area which PowerShell is sort of born to do, right.

127
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:30,951
The reason we have PowerShell in the first place is not everything was a file, document-based management in

128
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:37,951
Windows it was goo, right. You had stuff in registry, stuff in API, stuff in XML, stuff who knows where,

129
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,951
and so PowerShell kind of originated as a glue language within Windows and has continued to grow into a bit

130
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:48,951
of a glue language as Erin pointed out, even a little bit of the we do spread our arms a little bit across

131
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:57,951
the shell and the developer scripting scenario and that's actually on purpose, right.

132
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:02,951
And there's that intent to have always be able to make you be able to do things in PowerShell.

133
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:07,951
It's not a single-purpose language on purpose, in this case, unlike other languages that I've participated in.

134
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:14,951
So we think in fact it as before in the DevOps world become more and more of a glue logic, our intention is

135
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,951
that it will in fact become known there and be able to do that.

136
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:23,951
As a part of making sure that happens, in version 2, we have no major announcements.

137
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:31,951
And in version 2, actually in version 1 of PowerShell when it first went out, we had no PowerShell on Windows.

138
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,951
You had to just download it. You guys might not remember. I remember this, right.

139
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,951
You remember. Okay, it was just a pain. You had to download it all.

140
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:45,951
In version 2, we wrote on the board our mantra was before everything else, PowerShell everywhere so that people

141
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:51,951
didn't have to do that, right. So our goal, in that case, drive was getting all skews of Windows.

142
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:55,951
And you'll see as we move forward and try to become more of both the glue language and technologies,

143
00:11:55,951 --> 00:12:01,951
that we're going to try to make sure we're able to push PowerShell technology everywhere whether it be DSC

144
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:08,951
or gallery or different components, we want to make sure that in fact that we're able to push things.

145
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:15,951
And we said before the open source will go or go on as fast as we can with as much as we can within the realms

146
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:25,951
of reasonable business and within the realms of our resources. And so, we're continuing to evolve that story,

147
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:30,951
but our goal is to make sure that our tools are available for you.

148
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:35,951
Yeah, I think as Kenneth say, well we want PowerShell everywhere, I mean, I think is the---

149
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:36,951
Technology everywhere.

150
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:41,951
Yeah, we want technology everywhere, but we want it to be a tool for everybody and I think that this is

151
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:46,951
something that as you start, you saw some of the predictions in the past and some of the predictions in the future,

152
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:50,951
you're going to start seeing more and more of that. Stay tuned.

153
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:56,951
Velocity. We haven't, we did start moving things a little quicker as you noticed.

154
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:03,951
That will continue. We're going to try to move them quicker and with higher quality moving forward and with

155
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:08,951
a little bit of communication all simultaneously. We'll try to get that stutter step working a little better.

156
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,951
There is a drive towards simplicity. Now this might not be obvious.

157
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:18,951
This is our last line. This might not be obvious, but we do actually try to make this so, that was the whole

158
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:25,951
intent of DSC. If you take a look at it from the user perspective, if there's a good match and take a look

159
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:31,951
at the PowerShell code, you get about a 10x factor of simplicity out of just a DSC configuration when it matches.

160
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:39,951
Now what we've got to do with DSC is make it easier to get there and make that more complete coverage.

161
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:47,951
Does that make sense? But the whole intent was reduce the challenge of complexity, so that we can achieve the

162
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:52,951
scale we need to in this industry and the rapidity of release we have to.

163
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:58,951
That's why we do DSC. And so we will take a look at both DSC and other technologies to try to make it

164
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:03,951
simpler and simpler for the end user or in certain cases. We recognize we don't always land in the first

165
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:10,951
place when you start looking at things like the pull server. And then last, but not least, there's _____ of completeness.

166
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:16,951
We talked a little about the scenario issues. How do we actually make sure we are complete and well-rounded?

167
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:25,951
That's where we're counting on you guys to do some UserVoice and feedback and to tell us what those issues are.

168
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:28,951
So with that said.

169
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:34,951
Yeah, I think, thank you. I think that the best way to finish is to thank all of you.

170
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:39,951
I mean, we come to work every day at Microsoft because of you. I mean, really.

171
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:44,951
PowerShell has been an amazing experiment. I've been with the team now; I think it's my fifth year now coming

172
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,951
in as a different role. Kenneth has been here for 10 years, 13, 13 years.

173
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:49,951
Thirteen years, something like that, maybe 14.

174
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:55,951
And it's amazing to see where we are. I mean, for me from five years ago to today, I mean I'm looking in this

175
00:14:55,951 --> 00:15:02,951
room and I'm looking at the other people and I'm looking at the momentum and it could not happen without you, your help.

176
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:06,951
So we need more help. We need more of you to basically contribute.

177
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:13,951
You know to help is basically take PowerShell for another amazing 10 years, so thank you from my point of view.

178
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:14,951
I don't know.

179
00:15:14,951 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you very much.
