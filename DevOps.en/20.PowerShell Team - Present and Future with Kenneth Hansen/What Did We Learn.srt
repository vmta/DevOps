1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,672
So with the great things in the past, I'm really happy about what the team has accomplished, what all of you help

2
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:11,672
to accomplish and it's that we learn a number of things and we want to share some of those learnings because

3
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:17,672
I know that some of the things that we're going to talk about today are things that you are aware and we are

4
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:23,672
aware as well and I want to address it, we want to address it from both angles for an engineer and as well as

5
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:30,672
for product management because when you're thinking about, for example, agility, I've got to say something

6
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:36,672
that we learn in Microsoft, when you try to ship in Windows and be agile, we learned that there are some

7
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:43,672
interesting challenges because engineering processes, cadence tooling, we are evolving in the company.

8
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:48,672
Yeah, sorry about that. So I'm going to give you a good example what happened in WMF 5.0 RTM and I know this

9
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:57,672
was painful for some of you. What happened is that frankly we had a bug, we recalled the bug back in December.

10
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:03,672
The amount of time it took us from taking that bug fix, we release a WMF 5.0, it was roughly like about two

11
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:05,672
and a half months, almost three months.

12
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:06,672
It was too long.

13
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:11,672
It was frankly a---you can ask tons of questions like you see if I was in your place, I would be asking like

14
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:17,672
wow what kind of bug is this. This is like so dramatic that it's taking the team so long or they didn't know the

15
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:24,672
uses of it, are there more quality problems, right? In the instance, frankly is that yeah, we had a bug,

16
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:27,672
part of our agility, we missed this bug, but it was that reaction.

17
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:33,672
The amount of time that it took us to react, it was primarily driven that when you got a bill, a Windows package,

18
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:39,672
it just takes a lot of time. We've got to go through a number of days and processes that really doesn't tie

19
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:44,672
well with the Windows shipping vehicle. So moving forward, we're going to change that.

20
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,672
We'll talk a little bit more about that.

21
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,672
We're working on that and we're working with the Windows team as well.

22
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:53,672
People have this in focus. It's just a whole corporate effort.

23
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,672
Yeah, absolutely.

24
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,672
And our efforts as well. We're addressing it at each layer as we can, I think is the right answer.

25
00:01:57,672 --> 00:01:59,672
So thank you for support

26
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:06,672
and apologize because I know this some of you took a dependency in the December release and definitely I know

27
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:12,672
that counts and it needs to and is something we're addressing, and we'll talk a little bit more on cloud.

28
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:19,672
It was a year ago Kenneth and I we were here talking about this transformation in the company culture, right.

29
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:24,672
The transformation is that when Satya took over the company as the CEO, it was very clear that we needed

30
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:31,672
to adjust, not adjust the way how we worked, but actually in the way how our engineering roles they were evolving.

31
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:37,672
So if you recall, the engineering role evolved in Microsoft where the developer and the tester became one

32
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:42,672
single role called software engineer. So we still, we've been evolving this.

33
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:47,672
They have a significant impact on all of us because when you think about Microsoft, we've been operating

34
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:52,672
under that moral for 35 years. In one day, we decide well we're just going to change all that.

35
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:59,672
Well a key example goes back into the open source stuff because like a few years ago, if I considered any of

36
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:05,672
those projects, I would have been escorted not so graciously out of the building, right.

37
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:06,672
SQL and Linux?

38
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:13,672
And so now it's a very different culture. It's a very different top/down mindset and there's

39
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:20,672
still a lot of how do I do my day job, exactly what am I responsible for that we still have to work through

40
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:25,672
and make sure we land the process, and occasionally, we're going to make just a few errors on our way,

41
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:30,672
so bear with us, we're on a, I think, great path, but we're not quite done yet.

42
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:33,672
I think we are definitely closer than ever before.

43
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,672
Amen. That's exactly right. Okay, we're sustained there.

44
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:42,672
As a part of that, we're actually going to continue to evolve how we're handling communications, right.

45
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:48,672
So let's talk about a few things going through there. One is even just during the re-release, we felt we

46
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:55,672
were pretty aggressive on the communication for the WMF recall. As we started the re-release over that period,

47
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:59,672
we kind of went a little quiet. It was like okay, we think we're going to have it the end of January and

48
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:05,672
then it was like oh, okay new problem, okay, into February, and I was a little frustrated from our standpoint.

49
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:11,672
I'm sure it was from your standpoint. And we're sort of working through exactly how when we have nothing to

50
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:20,672
say, we say something, so the people know we haven't forgotten you, but I've got nothing more I can tell you

51
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:26,672
and how do we do that? There's some pros and cons to doing that every minute versus every week versus every

52
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:32,672
month and sometimes as you go through that as we work this journey, there's times where as we communicate

53
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:38,672
more frequently, we will have a tendency to get it a little wrong because we even have been a place in that

54
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:43,672
case where I would have said four days before an event, hey it's going to be this date and then like three

55
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:48,672
days later, oh no, it's not. And so, we're struggling with ourselves and we'll work through that with the

56
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:53,672
community, sort of get a sense as to how we communicate these events.

57
00:04:53,672 --> 00:05:02,672
So just to be clear, A, we definitely want you to know everything you need to know to get your jobs done and

58
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:07,672
to make you comfortable, and B, we're working pretty accurately through that process and how we can address

59
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:12,672
our needs and your needs simultaneously. We do ask for your continued support and a little patience as we

60
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:17,672
sort of fight through that. In general, we'll probably opt to communicate a little more than what we have in

61
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:22,672
the past, but just be aware that there's always trade-offs here.

62
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:30,672
Just as an observation, we continue to move still fairly quickly through the preview and the various models

63
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,672
and I would say finally we're beginning

64
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:36,672
to get it, and on the other hand, we just started the home page based on people's lack of how to where do I go

65
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:41,672
to get a canonical sense of what PowerShell's really doing. I get all these different blogs and so forth.

66
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:46,672
We started the home page for that. We started the gallery. We started all these projects up and I would say

67
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:53,672
that over the next five to six months we're going to be sort of more operationalizing some of the

68
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:56,672
communication efforts that we have around them. How do we do this?

69
00:05:56,672 --> 00:06:04,672
One thing we've thought about doing we'll see how it flies, but it's certainly on the fun idea list is maybe

70
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:09,672
we'll end up doing it every other month little top of mind where I'll sit down and maybe Angel will join me

71
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:16,672
and we'll do a looking back last month, looking forward the next month, and here's some key technology things

72
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:23,672
that we're thinking about and then maybe once in a while, we'll also do maybe sort of more of a Q and A,

73
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:28,672
a broader Q and A with the whole community. We just finished a couple hours this morning with a group on DSC.

74
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:33,672
That was a useful, it turned out not to be DSC, a bunch of things, but that kind of thing is on our mind.

75
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:39,672
I don't know why or where we'll land on them, but we certainly want to make sure that we involve and integrate

76
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:45,672
more and more. Let me, I'm going to spend just a little more time, I know I should probably talk about all the

77
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:51,672
stuff we're going to do, but since I'm here, I guess I'll end it here and then we'll come back to it.

78
00:06:51,672 --> 00:07:01,672
Innately, the community is immensely hugely larger than the PowerShell team.

79
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,672
Right. There are just more people out there, which is good because that's how we make money, right.

80
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:12,672
If we didn't, then Windows might be bad. With that many downloads, you know people are using, 1.3 million,

81
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:17,672
even if some are Azure, people are using the technology they've got in production.

82
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:23,672
There's going to be a ton of questions. I have always been astonished that for the past 10 years when we do

83
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:33,672
a new PowerShell session and even the getting started sessions that Don or Jeffrey occasionally do are packed

84
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:41,672
with 1,000 people. After 10 to 15 years, alright 13 years of talking about PowerShell at the various

85
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:49,672
Microsoft events, we still have hundreds and hundreds of people who have never touched it yet.

86
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:54,672
That's going to continue. What that means is we got a lot of people not only in the community now, but a ton

87
00:07:54,672 --> 00:08:00,672
coming in and then we have the audacity to create new technologies like DSC, which for people who are already

88
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:08,672
here create a whole new set of questions and issues and things, so we rely on the community.

89
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:14,672
We rely on the community to help the community. I know we can't scale to do that.

90
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:21,672
What we can scale to do is to engage and understand when there are firestorms and engage in the firestorm,

91
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:25,672
try to prevent it with some documentation and we can educate the educators.

92
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:32,672
We can talk to you guys. Does that make sense? There is this layer between us where we just have to actually

93
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:37,672
use you and other people like you. When we started the first PowerShell summit, I spent a little while on this,

94
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:41,672
but when we started the first PowerShell summit it was because in fact we were at a Microsoft conference,

95
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:50,672
TechEd Europe, I think it was Berlin, and Jeffrey and I had just finished a, we'd had again a massive intro

96
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:56,672
session and then we'd had an ask the experts kind of a thing and we filled it and we filled it again the

97
00:08:56,672 --> 00:09:03,672
second day we actually had to turn people away and we just said okay where can we go to give people really

98
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:09,672
in-depth knowledge of PowerShell. And we said, we've got to have our own little conference, don't we?

99
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:13,672
And then we said, that was one breath, the second breath is and we can't do it.

100
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:20,672
Because if we do it, Microsoft has an attention span of a nat. It's like oh, a new thing.

101
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:26,672
And so, we said the community has got to be able to come together and do that and that's when we worked with

102
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:31,672
Don and others to try to pull together the very first PowerShell summit in Red Rock Las Vegas four or five

103
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,672
years ago

104
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:40,672
and the intent there was we'll talk to you guys and we'll get you guys to help us improve our product because

105
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:44,672
you have higher access and they have a high bandwidth conference for you guys to make sure you connect with us later.

106
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:49,672
So I'm sorry for that long soliloquy. I just want you to get a sense of that's how I think of it, that's why we

107
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:54,672
spend so much time on these things. We really want to get educated by you and to make sure that you guys

108
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:58,672
have the right message. So if there's problems you're having in the community, if you're answering questions,

109
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:04,672
unable to do them, answer them, answer them, answer them, when you hit a brick wall, reach out to us directly.

110
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:10,672
Go ahead and reach out to the Powershell PM team at microsoft.com, go ahead and reach out directly on UserVoice.

111
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:15,672
Do that kind of thing which will inform us that you need help communicating with other people because we

112
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,672
don't always know. We can't always know.

113
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:25,672
I think I just want to highlight one point. I think that, look, we are moving a lot faster than ever before

114
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:29,672
and I know that we caused some pain last year with the WMF previews, right.

115
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:34,672
We were releasing these previews and it sounds really good, but in reality, we are not keeping track and

116
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:39,672
communicating how those previews they were affecting each of you with the changes that we were making in the technology.

117
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:44,672
So we need some times the help of the community because as we start having these communication channels,

118
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:50,672
if we start basically train the trainer I think at this point, which who is you, we need to be able to depend

119
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:55,672
on our community as well to help us through Twitter, through Facebook, through all the different channels

120
00:10:55,672 --> 00:11:01,672
where we start seeing a lot of momentum about communicating about PowerShell issues or PowerShell feedback,

121
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:03,672
so it's really, really important.

122
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:04,672
Absolutely.

123
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:08,672
And just to be clear, along with the general community engagement, which we'll up a bit, we'll go through

124
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:13,672
that in the next slide. We do have actually in the past year, we've had hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of

125
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,672
in fact, direct customer engagement with some specific cases. If there are people you think that have a

126
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:22,672
particularly interesting set of use cases for PowerShell or PowerShell DSC, reach out to me,

127
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:28,672
my team KenHansen@powershell.com or my team and actually just talk to one of my guys or Ron Hill and we'll

128
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:35,672
put them on the list of people that we will potentially go and just chat with and drill a little bit into their scenario.

129
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:40,672
We can only spend, obviously, we only have so much effort, but it's an important list to us.

130
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:46,672
We're always happy to add to it and it's been I would say increasing by probably a fact of 20 over the past
