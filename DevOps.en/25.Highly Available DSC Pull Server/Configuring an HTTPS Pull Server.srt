1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,779
So here's the thing,

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:08,779
when you make a MOF out, so you wrote your config, you run your config, your config makes a MOF.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,779
We need to change the name of this and there's two ways we can deal with this.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:18,779
First of all, I'm going to show you the old fashioned way, which Morawski and I actually still really like this way.

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,779
Yeah, what?

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:21,779
I like it too.

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,779
Oh, you like it too. Okay, good, good. We're on the same page because this way works.

8
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:32,779
Oh, this is not a good thing. So we need to change the name of this and here's what we're going to change it to.

9
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:41,779
We're going to change it to a GUID, a GUID, that really long ugly number and we're going to then tell the nodes

10
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:49,779
that we, the ones that we want to use that config, we're going to tell the nodes in their LCM what GUID

11
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:55,779
number they're supposed to look for. So what this means is on your pull server, you're going to have 6,000 GUIDs

12
00:00:55,779 --> 00:01:00,779
out there for whatever configs you have. Now the cool part to this is it's really easy to manage.

13
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:05,779
If I have 50 machines that need the same config, guess what I'm going to tell 50 machines LCMs?

14
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:06,779
(Audience comment)

15
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:12,779
Same GUID number. So I just have to have one out there and I can manage 50 machines with it, but it can be a

16
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,779
little bit confusing, so let's go ahead and take a look here.

17
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:20,779
First of all, the order or sequence I'm going to do this in is I'm going to start with the LCM of a

18
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:28,779
particular machine, so let's do this. Here's what I need. The LCM configuration, let me drop this down a

19
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:34,779
little bit, I need a GUID, so I've just got a parameter here where I'm going to pass the GUID.

20
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:39,779
Now I'm just going to generate one and pass it into the LCM. I also need something else.

21
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:48,779
I'm using a secured pull server and so I need the thumbprint for the certificate on that secured pull server.

22
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:55,779
So there's two things I need for this. Now down here in the settings, I'm going to do ApplyAndAutoCorrect.

23
00:01:55,779 --> 00:02:02,779
I need to set the refresh mode to pull because by default it's push and this is where I'll put in the

24
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,779
ConfigurationID and here's the interesting part.

25
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:12,779
ConfigurationRepositoryWeb, this is how I tell it what web server to go to that's the pull server.

26
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:19,779
So take a look. The server URL is the URL of your pull server and you need to put in the thumbprint for the

27
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:23,779
CertificateID and set AllowUnsecureConnection to false.

28
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:29,779
Pretty simple, right? Not that hard. Not that hard. So I'm going to run this.

29
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:35,779
Oh let me show you down here. Now I got yelled at on Sunday. Here's how I make my GUID.

30
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:39,779
Who wants to yell at me? Who was here earlier that wants to yell at me?

31
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,779
Good because don't yell at me because I'm not going to. This is how I make my GUID.

32
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:50,779
There's apparently, I never looked, there's a new cmdlet in v5 called New-GUID.

33
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:57,779
So and here's how I get my thumbprint. I'm actually going to go to the pull server and this is kind of useful.

34
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:01,779
I'm going to look at the pull server certificate store and where the FriendlyName is,

35
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:06,779
whatever you FriendlyNamed your certificate, and then select ExpandProperty's Thumbprint.

36
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:10,779
That grabs the thumbprint for me, so it's real easy. Kind of cool, kind of cool, kind of cool, kind of cool.

37
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:18,779
So I'll run this. Woo! And theoretically, I'll get a MOF and there's the MOF.

38
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,779
I could show you the MOF, but we don't care what's inside the MOF.

39
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:25,779
It's a meta MOF, meta, meta, meta MOF. So I'm going to set server1.

40
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:30,779
I've got two servers that we're going to play with. Server-1, I'm going to set his LCM.

41
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:38,779
Now just to let you see here and I'll bring this up a little bit, you can get the information for the LCM and

42
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:43,779
look at all this. It doesn't open up your configuration stuff, so when you're trying to troubleshoot stuff

43
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:51,779
and you want to see what's in there, just expand property on that and it'll show you what's inside so you can

44
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:56,779
troubleshoot including the thumbprint and all that kind of stuff if you run into issues with it registering.

45
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,779
We good so far?

46
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:06,779
Okay, so I have a node that has now been told here's the GUID I want you to look for when you go to the pull

47
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:15,779
server I told you to go to. Are you with me so far? Now I need to make a config and name it with that GUID number.

48
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,779
So I got a simple config. This is just going to install the SNMP service.

49
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,779
It's not a, I'll show it to you, it's not a real big deal. So just something really simple.

50
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:32,779
I'll run that. I want you to notice the name of it is S1.mof. We don't want it to stay that way, so I'm going

51
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:38,779
to put it on a pull server. First of all, I'm going to get the GUID and a variable from one of the nodes

52
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,779
that I had set. Boink. And now I'm just going to rename that file to that GUID.

53
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:51,779
Boink. And I'm going to put it on the pull server, but before I do, I need you to understand something.

54
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,779
This is tricky. This is also something that throws off people when they're trying to troubleshoot this when

55
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,779
it doesn't work.

56
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:00,779
What's going to happen is the first time it's going to work just fine, but at some point, you're going to

57
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:08,779
modify the config, run the config again, rename it to the GUID, and copy it back out to the pull server and

58
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:14,779
then you're going to wonder why your changes never go to the node. Got it.

59
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:20,779
Here's the thing, we need a checksum file. So this will make a hash and no it's not Shaw256.

60
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:27,779
I don't care what Steve says. We're going to make a hash and so you always have to make sure that every time

61
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:34,779
you modify your configs, you make a new checksum for it and you put both of them up there.

62
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:39,779
The LCM will know that there's been a change to the configuration by checking that checksum, so that's the

63
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:46,779
thing that really throws people off when they do this. Now at that point, I'm just going to copy it up there

64
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:53,779
to my pull server. I only have one, but I'm just going to copy up the GUID stuff or all that stuff and I just

65
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:58,779
want to show you that it's on the pull server. Now this is the location where you put your configurations is

66
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:10,779
WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration. You're not impressed, but okay fine, be that way here.

67
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:19,779
See them. See them? Oh, let me pull this up. Ahh. Okay, great you're applauding that.

68
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:26,779
All I did was copy a file, right. Now I could sit here and wait and the LCM will eventually pick this sucker

69
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,779
up or I can just kick him in the pants and that's what I'm going to do, so we don't have to sit here and wait

70
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:38,779
all day, well at least 15 minutes. So I'm going to update that configuration.

71
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:45,779
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Now I can't that stupid thing out of my head.

72
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,779
I hate that. Oh and by the way, right now he's running the config.

73
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,414
Isn't that cool? So the node actually-- yeah. Yeah, okay you're not that impressed.

74
00:06:54,414 --> 00:59:59,999
Okay, but you should be.
