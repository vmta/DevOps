1
00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:22,22
Alright, so how many of you have been to my other sessions? Okay, because if you haven't, you are really in

2
00:00:22,22 --> 00:00:27,27
the deep end of the pond at this point. This is the end, so to speak.

3
00:00:27,27 --> 00:00:34,34
And what we're going to do is we're going to talk about DSC. We've already in other sessions built pull servers.

4
00:00:34,34 --> 00:00:44,44
I already have a pull server. Pull server. Pull my finger, oh okay, no you're not going to do it, are you?

5
00:00:44,44 --> 00:00:49,49
And so, what we're going to do now is this is really the hard part that throws a lot of people off when they

6
00:00:49,49 --> 00:00:57,57
start with DSC is how do I get configurations on a pull server and how do I get resources on a pull server so

7
00:00:57,57 --> 00:01:06,66
that when a node goes ask that pull server says hey I want this config and the config needs additional resources,

8
00:01:06,66 --> 00:01:12,72
then it'll just download the resources that it needs. So I don't deploy these resources, it just gets what

9
00:01:12,72 --> 00:01:15,75
it needs when it actually runs. Now if

10
00:01:15,75 --> 00:01:22,82
you don't know this, here take a, use your phone, take a picture of this, whatever.

11
00:01:22,82 --> 00:01:26,86
Here's where all the code is. This is actually the entire code that I did for the PreCon.

12
00:01:26,86 --> 00:01:33,93
So this is start to finish DSC stuff starting out with how to write a config, how to manage the LCM,

13
00:01:33,93 --> 00:01:41,101
all that kind of stuff. Take a picture because I'm going to make it go away.

14
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,105
So I put together a ton of code for you. What we're going to do is the last two modules and we're going to

15
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:52,112
do it really fast because this is short session, so and also Morawski's little reading list on DevOps.

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,116
It's an excellent reading list. And I think that's all I need to show you.

17
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:04,124
So here's what it looks like when you get the code, you will get a zip of looks like this.

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:11,131
Underneath a make a Scripts folder if you want to play with this at home and then copy DSCPreCon right there,

19
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:16,136
and underneath DSCPreCon, these are all the folders of all the code

20
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,141
and a ton of stuff in there, so you have a lot of fun. What we're going to focus on is the last two,

21
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,142
so I'm going to go

22
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:28,148
into PackagingConfigs and we're going to give this a shot. Everything starts with a demo script that actually

23
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:33,153
walks you through everything one step at a time, so let's do this, shall we?

24
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,157
Oh, that's not what I wanted. What am I doing? I'm in the wrong, ah.

25
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:44,164
Now you have to do it all over again. There we go. Make this a little bit bigger.

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:59:59,999
Oh, that's good. You guys see that okay? Awesome.
