1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,276
So I'm going to set the LCM for these guys.

2
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:09,276
What I have is this is the way I usually do my LCM configurations, I separate the config data.

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:13,276
You don't see this a lot on the internet. This is actually a really cool way to do it, so all the config

4
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:19,276
data's up here for the LCM and then I can just tell it how many machines, whatever machines, and what roles I

5
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:22,276
want them to have and I never have to touch this code down here again.

6
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:31,276
So I just think this is a cool way to do an LCM. It's going to do multiple machines and here's where, I had this

7
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:39,276
cute little line of code and apparently now in v5, you can just do this.

8
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:45,276
Instead of the two lines of code, I'm going to show you, I'm just going to go bump, bump.

9
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:51,276
Whoops. I did it to the wrong thing. I am a moron. This line of code.

10
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:58,276
You just give it the path to them and it'll, all the ones that it sees there, it'll just kick them out.

11
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:18,276
Well now I broke this update computername s1 and s2. Yeah, that's the one machine, yeah that stupid config name registration.

12
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:25,276
You telling me it's not going to work at all? S2 is working. I'm going to try and see if I can get s1 to work

13
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:29,276
because s2 just registered, so let's see here. It's going to take a minute for this config to run.

14
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:34,276
I'm going to re-run it again to see if it picks up s1.

15
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:38,276
But the idea here is besides the config name bug, we bundled and put the resources up.

16
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:43,276
Here's the cool thing. One machine needs all four of those resources.

17
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:50,276
The other machine only needs two of those resources, so we only bring down the resources that machine needs.

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:55,276
We don't just copy them all down. Now here's what's going to happen, the resources must be available on the

19
00:01:55,276 --> 00:02:02,276
pull server when the LCM runs the MOF because the first thing he's going to do is look at the MOF and go what

20
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:07,276
resources do you need and then he's going to go do I have access to those.

21
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:11,276
So he's not even going to start jamming on it until he can get those resources down.

22
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:17,276
I'll show you here in a second. Oh, that was awfully quick for you.

23
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:23,276
That was way too quick for you. Cannot invoke, oh, it's still in progress.

24
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:32,276
Okay. I'm going to do something I probably shouldn't do. You're not going to let me do it, are you.

25
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:38,276
Well let me show you if the resources got out there and I can't believe this, but my beautiful, it worked fine

26
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:45,276
on Sunday before they updated the module. No, it's not put them out there yet.

27
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:53,276
Okay, let's do this. You're really messing up my applause line, man.

28
00:02:53,276 --> 00:03:04,276
Yeah. Yeah. That's just a shame because I don't think either one of them got set up because it was way too fast.

29
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:12,276
Yeah, that's a shame. Well I'm sorry guys, but you don't get to see the pretty website.

30
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,276
Did you even care about the pretty website? Of course you cared about the pretty website and I can't get it

31
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:20,276
to work now! Ahh.

32
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:24,276
(Audience comment)

33
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:33,276
Well I'll tell you what. I want to make sure that we don't go over here, but maybe I can.

34
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:46,276
Let's do this real quick. Let me see if I can, let's do this. Remove-DscConfigurationDocument to CimSession

35
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:57,276
s1, oh he's only going to let me do 1, Stage pending. Now a lot of times you have to do this when you're

36
00:03:57,276 --> 00:04:02,276
troubleshooting something that gets stuck. Okay, he doesn't have one.

37
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:07,276
Consistency check, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Now let's try to run it again.

38
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:15,276
Maybe I can get him to go. Come on, do me a favor, just work. You're not going to do it, are you?

39
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:21,276
Nope, there's something in that update that came down that he isn't going to do it.

40
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:27,276
Oh, this says the checksum failed. Oh, maybe I can fix this. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

41
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:35,276
Let's just make sure that I got everything zipped correctly and let's make sure I got some checksums.

42
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,276
We'll make new ones.

43
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,276
(Audience comment)

44
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:44,276
Yeah, the force is overriding it. If you don't use -Force, it won't actually overwrite your earlier checksum.

45
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:47,276
That's another little trick.

46
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:50,276
And let me copy them back up there. And let me make sure I've got them all copied.

47
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:53,276
You know, I may not have copied them up there, so we may still get to see a website.

48
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:57,276
Now I'm setting your expectations and if it blows up, I'm going to look like a moron.

49
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:59,276
Okay, there they are. There they are. On the pull server. Okay, let's try it again.

50
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:08,276
Let's try it again. Cross your fingers, right now, cross your fingers.

51
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:13,276
Oh well. Uncross your fingers. We're not going to get the website guys, but

52
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:18,276
the moral of the story is that the packaging of those modules is very finicky about the names and I want to

53
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:29,276
go back to this one thing on checksums. This -Force, nobody puts that in and they can't figure out why they

54
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:32,276
can't get their updated modules to work

55
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:38,276
because the checksum doesn't get updated. I think that by default, it should just overwrite it, but it doesn't.

56
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:44,276
So -Force is like saying overwrite the existing checksum because what it does is it goes oh, you have a checksum,

57
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:50,276
I'm not making a new one, which seems kind of ridonkulous to me, so -Force is very important right there to

58
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:55,276
make him go just do it and life is good.

59
00:05:55,276 --> 00:06:01,276
Is it new? Because before I always deleted the checksum and then rewrite it.

60
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,276
Is -Force new?

61
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,276
Yeah.

62
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:10,276
I think so because I used to always delete them too. Yeah, so I'm thinking that that's new.

63
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:14,276
But I do know this, it doesn't work unless you have -Force. Ta-da!

64
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:16,276
Is that broke, an error?

65
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:23,276
No, it doesn't throw it because it's not an error. You say New-Checksum, it goes oh you already got one.

66
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:30,276
That's not an error in his mind. I think it's an error. So yeah, you end up troubleshooting it for like

67
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:34,276
three days because you can't figure out what's going on until you notice that the, you actually look at the

68
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:37,276
checksum and you notice it's not getting updated in there.

69
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,276
(Audience comment)

70
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:42,276
Yeah, or if you think to manually delete it and do it.

71
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,276
(Audience comment)

72
00:06:45,276 --> 00:59:59,999
Oh yeah, in verbose you can see it. If you read the verbose output, yeah you can see it in there, yeah.
