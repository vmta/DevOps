1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,5
So what questions do you have?

2
00:00:04,5 --> 00:00:07,5
Come on, anything.

3
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:08,365
Partial configurations.

4
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:12,365
No, we're not talking about partial configurations. Next question.

5
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,365
No, go ahead.

6
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:19,365
Because with a partial configuration in pull mode, you have to use the friendly name and a configuration number,

7
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:26,365
so are you stuck using the friendly names in that case? As far as I've seen, there's no way to do it using

8
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:27,365
the pull mode right now.

9
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:31,365
No, you're right. You need both of them right now. So I'll be honest with you, I'd stick with GUIDs if you're

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:36,365
doing partials right now altogether and not use any config names.

11
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:37,365
(Audience comment)

12
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:42,365
And if I were you, and I was just about to say, if I were you, we have this whole big thing, matter of fact,

13
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:50,365
I was just, you all know who Bruce Payette is? The great god of the linguistics in PowerShell?

14
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:57,365
Okay, what we've been saying for days, we keep telling, we tell this to customers on it, don't do partial configs.

15
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:02,365
There's only one case scenario for it and it's because you don't have an HR department capable of firing people.

16
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:10,365
Don't use partial configs. They will hurt you. The right way is to use a composite config.

17
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:14,365
That also goes through your build pipeline correctly and doesn't screw everything up.

18
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:22,365
Partial configs, you will die a 1,000 cuts. So I was talking to Bruce Payette last night and I said what's the

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:31,365
real, what's your view on partial configs and he just turned to me and went we shouldn't have done that.

20
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:38,365
Thanks, Bruce. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. But yeah, so I know that there are case scenarios for

21
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,365
partial configs, but please avoid those. Use a composite config.

22
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:47,365
It just makes your life easier than running partials. What else you got?

23
00:01:47,365 --> 00:02:00,365
(Audience comment)

24
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:04,365
Yeah, and you know what's funny is that is exactly the answer I was going to get.

25
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:09,365
Your MOFs have to be versioned control by a version control source. They're not putting version control numbers

26
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:18,365
in the MOF, so what you want to do is whatever your source control is going to be like Get, whatever in GitHub,

27
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:23,365
that's where that versioning gets done. And I would dare say that you do the same process with your resources.

28
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:29,365
That's going to be in version control. You just have to make the name of the resource follow that,

29
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:34,365
you have to understand that versioning for those. That's a really good question.

30
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:38,365
Are you guys going to use pull servers or are you guys going to come up with your own way of doing it?

31
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:42,365
(Audience comment)

32
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,365
It has.

33
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:48,365
Right now, I feel like it either has to be both or I need toâ€¦

34
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:54,365
Okay, so there's a lot of companies that do push, they build their own push environments.

35
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:59,365
You're one of those. There you go and there's nothing wrong with that.

36
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:03,365
They are working on this pull server. I don't know if you've looked at the Azure automation stuff.

37
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:09,365
An Azure automation DSC pull server is a little bit more refined than our current on-prem pull server and

38
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:14,365
they're going to make a concerted effort to get the on-prem pull server, they've just been focusing on Azure.

39
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:20,365
Are you with me? You can use an Azure based pull server and let me tell you one of the benefits is we've got

40
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:27,365
encrypted MOFs on the nodes. These MOFs aren't encrypted on your on-premise one.

41
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:34,365
So somebody could just go hack the, just look at the ones on your and see things like if you forgot to secure

42
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:41,365
your credentials and that kind of stuff. On the Azure automation one, that pull server has encrypted MOFs on both sides.

43
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:46,365
It automatically encrypts the MOFs on the pull server and on the node, so that's kind of a benefit.

44
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:52,365
If you can have that hybrid approach, that's a really good pull server option right now to use.

45
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:58,365
This one, I use this in production all the time. While I'm not using config names this week,

46
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:06,365
that was supposed to be a joke, but I use this all the time and they're working on improving it really rapidly, so.

47
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:12,365
Also because, and I just want to tell you this, in the process of fixing some of this stuff, they've changed the

48
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:18,365
database type from JET to ESENT. Does anybody know what ESENT is?

49
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:20,365
Do I have any Exchange people in here?

50
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:22,365
(Audience comment)

51
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:28,365
It went from an MDB to an EDB. And now here's the funny part because I was asking one of the team members

52
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:29,365
yesterday about

53
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:39,365
this. I asked them, I said any Exchange guy that goes out and looks at this folder, let me just, is going to freak.

54
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:54,365
Where do I have it? Dc\C$, Program Files, Windows PowerShell, DSC.

55
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:59,365
Notice the old MDB is still out there because when they made this change last week, they didn't want to kill

56
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:08,365
your database, existing one, but they made a new one. Yeah. Yeah, it's why you didn't notice it and I just needed

57
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:11,365
see those things called .logs,

58
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:16,365
here's what I don't know. Any Exchange guy looks at this, the first thing they go is

59
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:21,365
Oh my God. And I said to the team member yesterday, here's the first question that should have popped out of

60
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:27,365
somebody's mouth as soon as it, because mine did, was are you using circular logging?

61
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:32,365
If not, how do I truncate these because there's no backup for this that's going to truncate these logs and

62
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:37,365
every Exchange guy knows your Exchange Server crashes because your backups aren't working and wouldn't truncate

63
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:42,365
the logs and it filled up all the disk space and it's going to do it in a heartbeat.

64
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:47,365
So I'm trying to find that information out and I'll put that up on powershell.org when we have some more

65
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:55,365
details on ESENT and how they intend to use this. I don't know if it's circular logging or not and I.

66
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:58,365
(Audience comment)

67
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:04,365
Well they could set it for whatever they wanted, so and that's what I don't know, so I'm trying to find that out.

68
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:11,365
But this change has just occurred, so don't be surprised when you go out there and see.

69
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,365
Oh, come on somebody had to watch Buck Rogers.

70
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:15,365
Yeah.

71
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:21,365
It's stage data. Oh, it was funny. Alright. What else?

72
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,365
Have you tried exploring the contents of that?

73
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:29,365
Not yet. I haven't had a chance. Because believe me I'm going to next week, but I haven't had a chance.

74
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:35,365
Because this literally just happened last week and I went oh, I wonder if any of my demos are now going to work.

75
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:46,365
(Audience comment)

76
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,365
Yeah, that's another thing. Yeah, that's probably something else that we probably should get around to fixing

77
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:54,365
at some point, yeah, or at least telling everybody that they need to make sure they delete that stuff.

78
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,365
Yeah, that's really good.

79
00:06:57,365 --> 00:07:02,365
So pull servers. They're great, but we need some more work on them, so have patience.

80
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:07,365
Play with it in your lab environment. Yeah.

81
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,365
(Audience comment)

82
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:15,365
I know. So was mine. Well because the engineer told me make sure that your web.config says ESENT instead

83
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:22,5
of JET and I'm like what? What just happened? (laughs)

84
00:07:22,5 --> 00:07:24,365
Yeah, and I don't have many details on this.

85
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:28,5
I think it's going to be really cool, but I don't have any details on this.

86
00:07:28,5 --> 00:07:34,5
The other thing is this makes high availability just a little bit more challenging because--

87
00:07:34,5 --> 00:07:39,5
I don't think they have any block replication capabilities like a DAG set up for this. (laughs)

88
00:07:39,5 --> 00:07:41,5
That's my other question too.

89
00:07:41,5 --> 00:07:48,365
(Audience comment)

90
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:54,474
Yeah, yeah. I think this is, from my initial set, I think this is probably a really good idea and those are

91
00:07:54,474 --> 00:08:00,480
really smart people on the team, so they don't do things haphazard, so I'm thinking this is a really good idea.

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,485
I just thought it was funny because my Exchange eyes just went--wahahaha!

93
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,488
Alright, guys. Well thanks. I'll stand up here if you want to ask any questions.

94
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,365
Other than that, go to lunch, have fun, and enjoy the rest of your day.

95
00:08:11,365 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you!
