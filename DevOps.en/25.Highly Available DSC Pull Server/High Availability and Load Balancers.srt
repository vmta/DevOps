1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,1
Kind of, sort of?

2
00:00:01,1 --> 00:00:04,4
Let's do resources real quick.

3
00:00:04,4 --> 00:00:06,984
Now this is supposed to have my beauty demo, but my beauty demo might fail

4
00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:12,984
because the one---I use config names and we'll see how it goes.

5
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:13,984
Huh, what?

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,984
(Audience comment)

7
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:21,21
No, I don't want to do that. I don't have that much time. Well we'll see.

8
00:00:21,21 --> 00:00:28,984
We'll see the beauty demo is awesome. Some if it'll work. So let's go down here and let's talk about resources.

9
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:31,984
Resources are more challenging.

10
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:45,984
Before we go on, can I ask you a question? So is there any reason to use config names other than GUID?

11
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:46,984
No.

12
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:49,5
I like GUID names. I don't think they're a problem.

13
00:00:49,5 --> 00:00:51,984
Stick it with GUIDs then.

14
00:00:51,984 --> 00:01:01,984
Well here's one thing we all just now learned. GUIDs work, and quite honestly, like I said, Steve and I still

15
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:05,984
prefer GUIDs, other guys prefer, yeah you prefer GUIDs, use GUIDs.

16
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,984
All the GP guys always use GUIDs.

17
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,984
There you go, so yeah, there you go. There's no reason not to use GUIDs.

18
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:16,984
This was something they threw in because everybody was, you've got to imagine everybody that starts with DSC,

19
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:21,984
they were complaining about the GUIDs because they didn't know what the hell a GUID was and they couldn't

20
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:26,984
figure out what they were doing with it and there was no, they didn't think of, somebody said well let's make

21
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:31,984
an Excel spreadsheet. No, don't do that, but you know. So that's why they put in config names.

22
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:36,984
I like config names. It's really useful, but. Guys, I'm going to make a couple of, I've got a configure that's

23
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:39,984
going to make some cool web servers.

24
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,984
You're about up to here with DSC making web servers, aren't you? Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:48,984
If you came to my thing on Sunday, we made domain controllers and stuff like that, but I know, it's kind of irritating.

26
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:54,984
It's just easy to do. I'll show you this config here in, if you want to see it, I'll give you the details of it.

27
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:59,984
This is just one of my configs. I separate my config data. It's going to build two different websites.

28
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,984
I've got two different roles in here.

29
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:07,984
It's going to use web as one of the roles, which configures a base web server with only the components that

30
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:12,984
I want configured in it. Then one of them is going to do an open site, which is just a regular HTTP site on

31
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:17,984
one server and one's going to do a secured site with an application and a custom resource.

32
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,984
I'm pointing this out because you're going to be writing custom resources left and right.

33
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:25,984
You've got to make sure you package them correctly for your pull server.

34
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:27,984
So let me just kind of show you here.

35
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:32,984
I guess I should run that because I'm going to need it. Oh, don't you dare.

36
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:41,984
Oh. Alright. What was the problem with this the last time I did this?

37
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:46,984
Could not find XDNS server. Oh, I haven't put the resources out yet.

38
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:51,984
See this red squiggly line? that means my authoring box doesn't have the resources.

39
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:53,984
That's part of my demo was to show you that.

40
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:56,984
I saw that one earlier. I noticed the red squiggles.

41
00:02:56,984 --> 00:03:00,984
Yeah, I didn't even read my own comment that says yeah, look at the red squiggle.

42
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:04,984
So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to copy the resources to my authoring box.

43
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:11,984
It goes out to Windows PowerShell modules and now the red squigglies, let me close this, and guys this is

44
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,984
one of those things you have to close it and reopen it.

45
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,984
(Audience comment)

46
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:22,984
Yeah, yeah. It won't re, yeah that it's not refreshing. I saw that was getting voted up too, that's good.

47
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:32,984
So now hopefully, my come on make the red squigglies go away. No.

48
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:37,984
XWebAdministration multiple yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:47,984
This is the problem I had yesterday. Find-module xwebadministration.

50
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:54,984
By the way, this is something that will happen to you, so might as well.

51
00:03:54,984 --> 00:04:01,984
AllVersions. NuGet, NuGet I am up to here with you updating NuGet.

52
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:08,984
Chocolatey NuGet. Oh. So here's the deal, a couple of days ago, a new version of this came out and that's what's

53
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:16,984
breaking my demo. I need to be on 1.9 and it's currently on 1.10, so let me get rid of on my machine has 1.10,

54
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:28,984
let me get rid of it and that's where I'm going to uninstall, uninstall-module -name xwebadministration.

55
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:29,984
Did I spell that right?

56
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:30,984
You did.

57
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:46,984
Okay, good. MinimumVersion1.10.0.0. Let's try this again.

58
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:53,984
No squigglies. Okay. Oh, don't. Golf clap. Anyway, so this is going to install.

59
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,984
Let me just run this, guys, so

60
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:59,984
we can start him off because he takes a few minutes to run and then we can kind of talk about him.

61
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:04,984
Notice I got two MOFs out there, s1 and s2. I'm going to show you another trick because I had my cute little

62
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:09,984
coding trick here and then Morawski yelled at me, so I'm going to show you, oh I'm going to change the names

63
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:20,984
of those files, so let me just rename them. I'm using a config name for those and let me make a checksum for them.

64
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:29,984
Ta-da. And I'm going to put them up on the pull server and here's the important part for this section.

65
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:34,984
I'm just going to put the configs up there, but now here's the hard part.

66
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:41,984
The resources have to get copied up there. Now they have to be copied into the DSC Service Modules folder,

67
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:48,984
but here's the challenging part. On your authoring box, your resources are PowerShell modules.

68
00:05:48,984 --> 00:06:00,984
They have to be zipped and use a special name. The special name is the name of the module_it's version number.

69
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:07,984
If you screw this up, it'll never work. You can't invent your own format for this name or the version numbering.

70
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:14,984
Here's where you have to go for this. The version numbering is in the manifest of each resource.

71
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:15,984
Now let me

72
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,984
give you an example here. Here's one of my custom, this is my custom resource.

73
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:26,984
I'm going to go into the manifest, see the module number? However that module number is listed must be the

74
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:30,984
way that it appears in the zip name. People mess this up all the time.

75
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:38,984
And I'm going to give you an example. I want you to see this because I looked at all the modules and got

76
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:47,984
their version numbers. This one was 1.2.0.0. This one was just 1.0.

77
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:52,984
It didn't have the other two, so it's got to match exact of what's in the manifest.

78
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:53,984
Does that make sense?

79
00:06:53,984 --> 00:07:01,984
Now here's the beauty of this. Because that version number is in there, you can have newer versions of these modules.

80
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:06,984
You can put them on your pull server. So you have version control on the pull server.

81
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:12,984
Maybe you have 50 machines using version 1.2 and you want to put a 1.3 version of the resource up, but you don't

82
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:17,984
want to break the 50 machines that are out there. You want to put a new version up and maybe put that on like

83
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:23,984
three machines you want to test. The beauty to that is just astounding in production.

84
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:30,984
There's only one small problem. How many of you know that class-defined resources, we don't have versioning

85
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:36,984
in class-defined. So here's the deal, I don't write class-defined resources other than to entertain myself

86
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:41,984
because I can't use them on a pull server because I can't version them, so I use standard resources.

87
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:48,984
Anyway, it doesn't matter. Actually, this PSWA authorization is a class-defined resource, but I'm not putting

88
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:49,984
another version up because it won't work.

89
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:58,984
So I'm going to zip this. Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip. And you need a checksum for those zips.

90
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:04,984
That way we know if it's been changed. Yeah.

91
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:10,984
(Audience question)

92
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:15,984
No. You still have to put the version number in there that's in the manifest for the class.

93
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:21,984
So that's actually really important. It's just you'll never be able to put another one on there until they fix this.

94
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,984
(Audience comment)

95
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:31,984
Because it doesn't know how to, it doesn't actually, the LCM doesn't know how to look for it with a class-defined resource.

96
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:37,984
They know this is an issue and they're going to fix it, but this has actually been on UserVoice for quite some time.

97
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:45,984
This has been an ongoing thing. And the thing is that in production is where you feel the pain.

98
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,984
Literally, Morawski and I were going through this because we were yelling at each other back and forth

99
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:54,984
because over skype one day because I'm like use class, use class, and he's like every version of a class-defined

100
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:59,984
resource, I have to bring up a new pull server because that's the only way you can do it.

101
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:07,984
Yeah. Ooh, and I'm like okay you win. Anyways, so let me copy these up and we'll run this and give it a shot,

102
00:09:07,984 --> 00:59:59,999
see how well it works here.
