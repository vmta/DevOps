1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,684
Now we're going to do it another way. A lot of people like this way.

2
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:11,684
I like this way because here's the thing, GUIDs are hard to manage because you can't tell what's inside the config.

3
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:16,684
In other words, you see a number and when you get 6,000 up there, well which one configures SNMP?

4
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:24,684
I don't know. Now it becomes really hard. Now most of us have created our tooling where we put the GUID

5
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:29,684
into a database along with a description of what it is and all that kind of stuff, so in other words,

6
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:34,684
we're kind of writing our own version of Chef, but it's really easy to---did I say that word Chef, yes,

7
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:39,684
I said that---but it's really easy to do your own tooling for this, it's just you're probably going to want it.

8
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:48,684
So let me show you another way. This is a new way. This came out last April in the previews stream of things.

9
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:53,684
I'm going to do the same thing I did before. I've got a simple config.

10
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:59,684
I'm going to run the config. It's going to say s1.mof. Here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to rename the

11
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,684
config, but I'm going to name it with

12
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:12,684
something a human can understand. See it's going to be---you don't look happy about this, but you should be.

13
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:20,684
So I'm going to rename it to RoleSNMP. I going to make a checksum for it because we always got to do the checksum.

14
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:25,684
And then, da, ta, da, na, na, na, na, na, I'm going to copy it up to the pull server again.

15
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:36,684
But now watch, looky, looky, looky, looky. Which one do you understand?

16
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:47,684
Yeah, see how cool this is? This also brings up a security issue because when it's a GUID, nobody knows what's inside.

17
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:52,684
When it's not a GUID and you use a human name, they know exactly what that config does.

18
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:57,684
That could be an issue. That's why you probably heard the team talking about this is why we're encrypting the

19
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:02,684
MOFs because of this right here.

20
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:09,684
So, but it's easier to manage. It's really cool. Now what we have to do is we now have to do something

21
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:12,684
kind of special. We need to teach

22
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:18,684
our pull server how to work with this technology called configuration names.

23
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:22,684
Now what Microsoft did is they're like, you can figure out what the configs are, so you can set any node to

24
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:27,684
pull any config because it's English readable, we're going to set up a registration key.

25
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:32,684
It's basically just a shared secret. We're going to put the shared secret on the pull server and we're going

26
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:39,684
to teach the LCM what the shared secret is. Only if you know the shared secret---how can you ask a question about that?

27
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:40,684
(Audience comment)

28
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:42,162
Oh go ahead.

29
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:48,684
I'm assuming that you do the name, the configurations, the pull server seem to be running on v5.

30
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,684
Oh, I should have mentioned that. Thank you very much. You are absolutely correct.

31
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:57,684
This has to be v5 deal. Config names, at least the last time I checked, did not work in v4.

32
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:04,684
So and then also, then I guess it applies that this node also has to be running in v5.

33
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:11,684
The node can be, as long as the LCM is version 2, so they updated v4 to have an LCM too.

34
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:16,684
So the LCM could be a version 4 that's been updated. Again, a really great question.

35
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:18,684
Guys, we need this registration key, so

36
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:23,684
I'm going to create a text file with a registration key in it. Of course, what we want you to put in here is a

37
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:24,684
GUID.

38
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:27,684
Good. I'm just using some numbers so you can see that it doesn't matter what you put in here.

39
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:36,684
So I'm just doing 1234567, I'll make this file, I'm going to copy this registration key up to the pull server

40
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:42,684
to a very specific location, WindowsPowerShell\DscService. This is the root folder for the configuration and

41
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:49,684
modules folders for the pull server and with that, thinking I don't have to prove to you that it's up there,

42
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:54,684
but let's go ahead and prove to you that it's up there. There's my registration keys.

43
00:03:54,684 --> 00:04:05,684
Got it? So now all I need to do is teach the LCM and I'm going to pick on the computer too.

44
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:10,684
I don't need a GUID anymore in this LCM config, so I remarked it out, so you can see it's out, but what I do

45
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:16,684
need to do is teach him the registration key and the configuration name.

46
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:24,684
So if you look down here, I set the ConfigurationID to blank because we're not using GUIDs and down here,

47
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:29,5
RegistrationKey and what role or what config name do I want him to use.

48
00:04:29,5 --> 00:04:32,684
Does that make sense? It's actually really, really easy.

49
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:39,684
(Audience question)

50
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:49,684
Some day. Also, I want you, great question, because I want you to also notice the word configuration names

51
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:57,684
and see my note that says there can be only one. Today, there can be only one.

52
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:03,303
Perhaps in the future, you could actually ask it for multiple roles and it'll munge it down to a single MOF.

53
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,304
(Audience comment)

54
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:14,684
Yeah. So I'm going to run this. Whoops. Hang on, hang on, hang on.

55
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:20,684
I screwed something up. What did I screw up? Connecting to remote server failed with username or password is incorrect.

56
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:30,684
What the hell are you talking about? My invoke-command failed? Wait a minute.

57
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:35,684
Wait a minute. Anybody see what I screwed up? Thumbprint because it's an empty string.

58
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:55,684
Yeah, I know. Oh, come on. Invoke-command Computer dc. I don't think my, wait a minute, I know my pull

59
00:05:55,684 --> 00:06:09,684
server is running. Oh, I don't know why he's in the middle of a reboot, but he had, and the thing is, I have the

60
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:17,684
LCM set on him to reboot if needed and apparently he needed. So anyway, back to.

61
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:26,684
Sorry about that. Let's try this again. Hey, here we go. That's much better.

62
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:34,684
So I'm going to now set that LCM on machine number 2 with that information and if we did everything correct,

63
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:40,684
put the registration key up, name the configs, configure the LCM correctly, if we did everything correct,

64
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:49,684
oh wait a minute, did I get another red splat? The underlying error is attempt to register agent, oh don't you

65
00:06:49,684 --> 00:07:03,684
do this to me. Seriously? Come on. I'll tell you what this is in a minute, what this error is.

66
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,684
If I run update, it'll suddenly work.

67
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:12,684
And mine's not and I'll explain to you in a minute why. Do you get the kind of concept though of using a config name?

68
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:18,684
I've got good news and I've got bad news with config names. The good news is it's pretty easy to manage because

69
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:26,684
now you can understand what the files are, it's easy to set up nodes with it, a lot of people really like this.

70
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:34,684
I'm going to get to the bad news in a minute. Look at the bottom of the screen, see.

71
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:46,684
So here's part of the bad news. If you want to use config names, you're pull server must be a graphical server.

72
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:56,684
I only work on Core servers. I only work on Core servers. I only work on Core servers.

73
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:02,684
I only work on Core servers. My pull server has to be a graphical-based server.

74
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:09,684
The reason is that when they wrote all this up, there's some dependencies still on the graphical desktop.

75
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:17,684
They are in the process of fixing it right now. As a matter of fact, the guy who is fixing it was here

76
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:23,684
yesterday morning going I'm fixing it. Because it's kind of embarrassing, right?

77
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:27,684
Your crap doesn't work on a Core Server from the team that made the Core Server and told everybody it's got

78
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:33,684
to be Core. Okay, you don't see the hilarity to that, but I certainly do.

79
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:37,684
There's another issue too. You are not going to reboot on me again.

80
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:44,684
Oh, okay. Just whatever. There's another issue. I built my pull server and when you build a pull server,

81
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:49,684
you need to get a module from the gallery called XPS Desired State Configuration.

82
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:54,684
Unfortunately, that module has changed version numbers as they're trying to fix this configuration thing.

83
00:08:54,684 --> 00:09:02,684
Twice in the last few days. I have the latest one and the latest one is causing an agent registration error

84
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:09,684
and that's the red error I got from server 2. You will get that error if you use config names today.

85
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:17,684
Hopefully, 3.10.0.0 will ship soon and that will fix it all. Are you with me?

86
00:09:17,684 --> 00:59:59,999
I apologize. It's just it is what it is right now.
