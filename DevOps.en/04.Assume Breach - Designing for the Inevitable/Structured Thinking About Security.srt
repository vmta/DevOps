1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,499
So the point here is that people say that threat modeling doesn't work and they really get stuck on that

2
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:13,499
document-driven approach. It's structured thinking about security that works.

3
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:20,499
Go back, put these things on a whiteboard. We'll be releasing this as a threat modeling template to help you

4
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:24,499
think through the different aspects of your system. Think it through.

5
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:29,499
Think through the different dangers of your components and your data stores and what you can do to help

6
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:34,499
restrict these and prevent any issues in the future.

7
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:40,499
Now what I wanted to do is talk a little bit about if people have questions about hey I'm designing,

8
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:46,499
I've got this system, obviously make it generic or whatever, but I wanted to sort of talk here about what do

9
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:52,499
people, what challenges are they running into? What are some opportunities for restricting a thing that

10
00:00:52,499 --> 00:01:02,499
you're nervous about? Any takers? Yes.

11
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:09,499
(Audience question) Yeah, so the question was when you start going down this path and somebody goes well

12
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:16,499
I'm like 14 layers in and if somebody abuses this API, bad stuff happens.

13
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:21,499
Ultimately, you're going to be constrained in the implementation effort.

14
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:29,499
And so, it's really important to be pragmatic about it. The way we like to focus it on what are your top five

15
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:36,499
worries and what are your top five unmitigated vulnerabilities, and then you just start prioritizing.

16
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:43,499
So you can say you know what, we've got like 10 issues that are way huger, let's not dig too much into this

17
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:52,499
first, let's start looking for things that we kind of in our guts know are higher priority, higher impact.

18
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:57,499
So that's kind of the way that I found it really helpful to just be pragmatic on the threat modeling,

19
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:03,499
rather than diving down to like kind of API levels and that kind of stuff.

20
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:11,499
Anything else? Yes. So the company that I was working for has had all there…

21
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:16,499
Yeah, so the question was, when you have two components that are communicating over PowerShell remoting,

22
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:21,499
should we be doing that over SSL? And that's a good example of somebody saying I've got two components

23
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:27,499
interacting, what is a danger, what are the information disclosure risks and everything.

24
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:32,499
On that perspective, we're actually working at releasing a PowerShell Remoting Whitepaper soon.

25
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:38,499
It's SSL is almost always better, it's almost always better. When it comes to PowerShell remoting,

26
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:46,499
we've taken enormous steps to ensure that PowerShell remoting, even without SSL, is a completely safe thing to do.

27
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:54,499
That's because PowerShell remoting uses Kerberos, which does the authentication mechanism in such a way that

28
00:02:54,499 --> 00:03:01,499
you can't really snoop it or sniff or anything else. It's the same thing as talking to SMB shares or anything else.

29
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:09,499
From then on, everything else in PowerShell remoting is encrypted by the protocol itself, and so SSL is important

30
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:17,499
to enable when you're using a basic authentication, for example, connecting to a WinRM endpoint over HTTP,

31
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:22,499
like something off in Azure, that's a good example where you're not within a domain environment.

32
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:25,499
Yeah, that's what I thought. But they were under the impression that…

33
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:32,499
Correct. You notice when you're about to do a bad thing with PowerShell remoting, you get so many error

34
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:37,499
messages about allow unencrypted connections and all these kind of things.

35
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:43,499
But that said, they had a valid concern that we didn't have it documented well enough, and so we're working

36
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:50,499
on that to get that out there so that you can just give them a document for them to kind of geek out on it

37
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:57,499
and understand the context. (Audience question) Yeah, the whole thing has got just tons of subtly.

38
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:04,499
It's really hard to keep them all in mind, especially when you're talking to somebody who is completely

39
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:11,499
involved in the risk mitigation department, and so it's a thing that we're going to work on making sure that

40
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:16,499
there's just kind of a document that people can read through. We're going to put it up there on TechNet.

41
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:21,499
We're going to continue to tweak it and make sure that these kind of concerns can be addressed so that we

42
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:28,499
don't feel like we have to individually fight the good fight. Cool.

43
00:04:28,499 --> 00:59:59,999
Well, thanks for your time. Go out and think about your systems and make them secure.
