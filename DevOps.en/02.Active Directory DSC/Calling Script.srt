1
00:00:00,75 --> 00:00:09,509
So then in my calling script over here, what I did was I took these files and I copied them from

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,509
there and I just put them out in my own GoateePFE AzureRM GitHub.

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,509
This is public and it's out there for you guys to use. So all these files that I'm showing you right now are

4
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:26,509
right here on the screen. So if you go out to github.com/GoateePFE/AzureRM,

5
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:30,509
you'll find these files and you can use them and tweak them up for your own purposes.

6
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:37,509
You can create a copy in your own GitHub and modify the configuration however you want and tweak a few things

7
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:42,509
and you can start spinning up your own domain controllers all day long, or if you're kind of lazy like me,

8
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,509
just run this one and just change the domain name. It doesn't have to be Alpine Ski House.

9
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:52,509
You can call it whatever you want and you can go in and edit things however you like and just make your own.

10
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:59,509
So you've got here the data file and then inside that zip, you're going to have the actual script file,

11
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:08,509
the ps1 configuration file and the resources in there. Alright so, basically all I'm doing then is I'm

12
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:11,509
taking that data, I threw it up on GitHub.

13
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:16,509
Now really and truly, you should put it in an Azure storage account where it's really secure and you're the

14
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:21,509
only person that can see it if you're going to use this in any kind of production capacity.

15
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:29,509
But all I did was I had to say Install-Module using the PowerShell get to pull down the Azure resource module,

16
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:37,509
install that, install AzureRM, and it goes out and it installs like 28 modules for you in AzureRM and this

17
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:45,509
all documented out there already. Install-Module Azure, Import-Modules are optional commands and then I just

18
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,509
log in, so really this is where it starts. I log into my AzureRM account.

19
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:57,509
So this is where---how many of you have an Azure account. Alright, you got a MSDN, your enterprise agreement

20
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,509
from Microsoft has Azure benefits, you can go get a trial. So as long as you've got some kind of account,

21
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,509
you just log in here, that's it. You put in your name and password.

22
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:13,509
In the past, you had to do all the subscription IDs and this jazz to try to run PowerShell commands against Azure.

23
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:20,509
Now this is all it takes. Log into my account, it knows all my stuff. I don't have to mess with all those extra parameters.

24
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:30,509
And so now, what I do is I give it the URL to my GitHub account and that azuredeploy.json file that I snagged

25
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:39,509
and edited out of that template library. And then I just---you can change these up.

26
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:48,509
I called mine GoateePSH and then RG for Resource Group, SA for Storage Account, and then AD for the DNS name.

27
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:51,509
So you can just tweak up those names right there, whatever you want to call those.

28
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:57,509
They do have to be lowercase and then you test their availability and make sure there's no DNS conflict there

29
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:03,509
in Azure and then you just create the resource group. So really what we're talking about to get this all

30
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:09,509
done is three commands, log in, create a resource group, and then you've got your parameters here pretty well

31
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,509
already populated, and then you just do the resource group deployment.

32
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:21,509
So three commands and in less than 30 minutes later, you've got a full-blown domain controller ready to bang on,

33
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:27,509
so those three commands. Now let's see, is it done? Let's take a look here.

34
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:36,509
It is. So let's take a look at the verbose output here. So here's the play by play on building it out.

35
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:43,509
We started at 3:05 PM and we scroll down. We saw it's deployed all these pieces.

36
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:52,509
It ends at 3:33 PM. I've noticed it takes 27-28 minutes on average for me and then it shows me at the very end,

37
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:58,509
here's my Azure resource group name and here are all the parameters that we passed in, here's the VNETs,

38
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:09,509
all that stuff, so it's done. It's baked. I've got a standard D1 Azure VM out there called adDC.

39
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:18,509
Now how do I get to it? Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this GetAzureRM public IP address

40
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:24,509
cmdlet and I just give it the resource group name, grab the first VM that comes back from that here,

41
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,509
and so I'm going to grab the IP and the FQDN of that domain controller that I just spun up in Azure.

42
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:36,509
Now, the other Azure cmdlets have this command called Get-AzureRemoteDesktopFile.

43
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:44,509
I haven't found the equivalent of that for the RM set of cmdlets, so I'll I did was just do a Start-Process

44
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:50,509
on the RDP client and pass it in either the FQDN or the IP, either one.

45
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,509
It doesn't care that I pulled out of that other information there.

46
00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:06,509
So now, I'm going to log in here as alpineskihouse/adadministrator.

47
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:13,509
In Azure, you can't use administrator for your AD name for your administrator account, so in this case,

48
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,509
the template said let's call it AD administrator and I'm fine with that.

49
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:24,509
And I'll put in my super-secret password here, make sure I type that exactly right.

50
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:30,509
Now this might take a minute connecting in for the first time. It's a brand new virgin VM out there in Azure.

51
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,509
It might just take a minute before it knocks the cobwebs out of its head

52
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,509
and it gets ready to roll. Here we go. It's spinning up.

53
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:44,509
So what you're watching on the screen right now is a brand new pristine Azure domain controller spinning up

54
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,509
for the very first time with an RDP session to it.

55
00:05:49,509 --> 00:06:01,509
And here it goes. Let's take a look here. AlpineSkiHouse logging in and now I've been talking this whole

56
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:07,509
time for 37 minutes, but really when we started this whole thing, I just ran three commands.

57
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:13,509
And now, less than 30 minutes later, I've got a fully populated Active Directory domain controller ready for

58
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,509
me to script and do whatever I want to do to test, so I'm not doing those things in production, right,

59
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:24,509
so I can test now out here on a clean VM. So it's spinning up

60
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,509
and as usual, it's taking a minute just the first time for the server to wake up.

61
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,509
So what are the things we're looking for now? We want to go see,

62
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,509
first off, is it a domain controller, did it really work, did it promote my domain controller, is the data

63
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:45,509
there, do I have the OUs, the users, and groups, is the recycle bin enabled?

64
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,509
Alright, I want to see if this thing is actually configured the way we defined it in the configuration.

65
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,509
So I'm going to go over here to tools. First thing you'll notice right here, remember the Active Directory RSAT

66
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:03,509
we installed in the configuration. The RSATs there. So now I'm going to go over here to Active Directory,

67
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:12,509
let's see, Administrative Center. There we go. And the Administrative Center comes up, I click on my Tree view

68
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:17,509
over here because that's my favorite view, I click on the domain and over here on the right, first thing you'll

69
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:23,509
notice is it's grayed out where it says Enable AD Recycle Bin, it's already done because the configuration told

70
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:29,509
it to enable the recycle bin. Now right here in the front list, you can see there's an Accounting OU,

71
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:35,509
there's an IT OU, a marketing OU, an Operations OU. Let's drill into one of those and there we go,

72
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:44,509
Computers, Groups, and Users exist. Now my Users OU, there's Debbie and Harriet, and if I look in the groups

73
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,509
there's G_Operations, which matches the department name in the OU there.

74
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:58,509
I open that group and I look at the members in that group and there's Debbie and Harriet.

75
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:07,509
So I've got an OU that has a group that has users, users in the group all with DSC out-of-the-box.

76
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,509
Alright, now let's go down and take a look at the users default container.

77
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:23,509
Down here, I have TestUser1, TestUser2, TestUser3, 4, 5, TestGroup1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and if I look in TestGroup1,

78
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,509
there's a member TestUser1.

79
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:34,509
What do you think? (Applause) Does that look handy for you? Yep.

80
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:41,509
Alright. So we've now in three PowerShell commands, you run those commands before you go to your morning

81
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,509
status meeting, you come back from your status meeting, you've got a domain controller ready to bang on.

82
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:48,509
Alright, just like that.

83
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:52,509
And then when we're all done at the end of the day, we've got a couple things here that we can do.

84
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:57,509
Number one, if you've been in Azure very long, you've already learned this lesson the hard way.

85
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:05,509
Shut down your VMs at the end of every day, right. So you want to run this command, Get-AzureRmVM.

86
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:12,509
This makes it so easy using the new resource manager cmdlets. Give me all the VMs in my resource group and stop them.

87
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:20,509
Done. They're stopped for the day or I can literally just run this one command, Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup,

88
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:29,509
I want to run that. Bada bing, bada boom. And if I come over here to my Azure view, all my resources,

89
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:34,509
you can see I've got two of these out there. I've got the PSH one and the AD one.

90
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:40,509
I built one just as a fall back last night. But if I keep refreshing this view, you'll watch these resources

91
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:50,509
start to drop off as it deletes them when I'm removing the resource group, and so it's performing that target right then.

92
00:09:50,509 --> 00:59:59,999
It's going to remove it and then we'll be all done.
