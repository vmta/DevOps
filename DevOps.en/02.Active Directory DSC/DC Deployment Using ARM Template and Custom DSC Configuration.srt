1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:04,229
Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to go ahead and we are

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:11,229
going to do this live right here today. So I've got some code. I've done my Login to AzureRM.

3
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:15,229
I'm going to come back and show you how this works. I'm going to create a couple of variables here that are

4
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:23,229
going to define the name of my resource group and then I'm going to just do a quick check to make sure that

5
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:30,229
DNS name is available. There's no conflict. There shouldn't be, there aren't that many Goatee instances out on Azure.

6
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:35,229
And then I'm going to spin up my Azure resource group. That one takes just a second to run.

7
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:39,229
That's good. And just like that, I created a New-AzureRmResourceGroup.

8
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:45,229
Now I'm just going to define a couple parameters, which are mostly variables already done here, I want to

9
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:53,229
go ahead and run those and now the big line right here, New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment.

10
00:00:53,229 --> 00:01:00,229
I'm just passing in the splat of parameters and let's go ahead and run that line as well.

11
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:08,229
This is the part, alright, it's going to ask me for my password, make sure I remember this, powershell5 thing.

12
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:21,229
Alright, password, got it. What? Man oh man. Provided value east us for the template parameter.

13
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:29,229
Guys, I have done this a million times and the only reason it's failing is because I'm in front of all of you right now.

14
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:38,229
Alright, what's going on here? (Audience question) Yeah, it is, but it's all lowercase.

15
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:48,229
Well, that one particular piece, yeah, you know what I've run this a million times just like it is.

16
00:01:48,229 --> 00:02:02,229
Oh, okay, yep, it is because I did change one last thing last night after I ran my demo, east, East US.

17
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:06,229
You're right. I did change that little spot after my demo practice last night.

18
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:12,229
That was a bad thing on my part. Now let's try it again. There we go.

19
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:20,229
Alright. Come on, baby. Got the -Verbose in there, so it gives me the play by play.

20
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:25,229
Alright. So what's happening now is I'm actually spinning up. I've got a new Azure resource group that I created.

21
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:31,229
Now I'm actually deploying to that Azure resource group a single domain controller, all the storage and

22
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:38,229
network and everything that goes with it and it's going to have a DSC configuration that I designed that was

23
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:43,229
custom for Active Directory and for my domain controller, the data that I wanted to go in there and that's

24
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:56,229
what I'm going to show you now is how that works. There we go. Get my prompt here.

25
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:01,229
I want to make sure this gets off and running because---okay, now we're good.

26
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:05,229
So we're creating a template deployment now for AlpineSkiHouseForest.

27
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:12,229
I'm tired of using Contoso.com. Anybody else? Alpine Ski House is one of the other legal approved Microsoft

28
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:17,229
fictitious company names. So Alpine Ski House sounds like a lot more fun than Contoso.

29
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:24,229
So let's get back to the presentation. We'll come back and see this in a minute.

30
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:32,229
So you came to talk about Active Directory in DSC. This is the xActiveDirectory resource module that you

31
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,229
can get at PowerShell gallery or you can go look at it on GitHub.

32
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:44,229
And in that module, there are a number of resources. Now how many have used this in DSC already?

33
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:48,229
Anybody? Just a couple hands, okay. So the main thing to understand here is the difference between

34
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:55,229
xADDomain and xADDomainController. XADDomain is going to be the first DC in the environment.

35
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,229
Every other DC after that in the same domain is going to be a xADDomainController.

36
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:06,229
Alright. And then xWaitForADDomain says once I've done the install, I need to make sure that it's come up

37
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:12,229
and it's responding, so that's the wait. And then once that wait is successful, I can contact the domain,

38
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:21,229
then I can go ahead and do my other resources here like DomainTrust, organizational units, users, groups, and so forth.

39
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:27,229
So those are the resources we have today in that module. It's bare minimum at this point.

40
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:33,229
It's been out there for a year and a half or so. We've got a little bit of traction out there, but there are

41
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,229
some other things in process.

42
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:41,229
The last I checked on GitHub, there's a default domain policy out there that's getting ready to be released soon.

43
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:48,229
Also, we're actually looking for people to help build this out. So if you do some AD PowerShell and you'd

44
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:54,229
like to help us add some resources here, we'd like to do a resource for just a generic Active Directory object

45
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:59,229
or setting permissions on something in Active Directory, tons of things we can add to this, you know,

46
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,229
sites and subnets, all that stuff.

47
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:09,229
So feel free to go out there to GitHub, take a look at it, and see where you can jump in and help.

48
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:12,229
So there's one person I would really like to thank and that's Iain Brighton.

49
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:20,229
This is the stats off of GitHub. Iain has done the most work on this module in the community.

50
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:27,229
So a big shout out to Iain for all of his work helping us move forward with the xActiveDirectory resource module.

51
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:34,229
So what we're doing today is deploying a domain controller using what's called Azure Resource Manager templates.

52
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,229
How many have heard of that before?

53
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:43,229
Okay. Now basically, instead of going and clicking through the Azure portal to do your resource deployment,

54
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:50,229
your---you've got to spin up, compute, and storage, and unicorns, and fairies, and all that in Azure to make

55
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,229
everything work right, and you can do that with code obviously because we're all PowerShell people in here.

56
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:02,229
But it's really easy now with Azure templates. You just say give me one of these and it just gives you all that stuff.

57
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,229
It just does automatically all the storage, and the compute, and the network, and all that, just builds it

58
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,229
all up for you and that's what I've been waiting on. See, now we're there, so I don't have to worry about

59
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:20,229
knowing all the 1s and 0s of everything I have to set up. So we've got that we're using and I used---I cheated

60
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,229
like everybody else. Hey, you know, when you write a script, you go look on the internet, find somebody else

61
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,229
that did it, and then you start with that, right? So I just went out to GitHub.

62
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,229
There's an AzureRM

63
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:34,229
section out on GitHub where we've published these resource templates, and sure enough, there's one there for

64
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:42,229
a domain controller, so I started with that. And then I snagged the latest Active Directory module here,

65
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:50,229
xActiveDirectory from the PowerShell gallery, and then I went out and watched Trevor Sullivan's video on

66
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:55,229
doing Azure Template deployments with PowerShell, some presentation he did over in Europe.

67
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,229
Everybody know Trevor Sullivan?

68
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:03,229
MVP? Yep, alright. So he did a really good job on that video. And then I did the

69
00:07:03,229 --> 00:59:59,999
phone-a-friend thing and all that and talked to some of my buddies and kind of put this, hacked this thing together.
