1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,046
So here's your call to action, help us grow the xAD resource in DSC.

2
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:13,046
If you've got a little bit of AD scripting skills, even if you don't have any AD scripting skills, just go watch

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,046
my videos out on Microsoft Virtual Academy. Anybody watch those?

4
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:21,046
There's a full eight sessions, full day of teaching you how to do Active Directory with PowerShell and then

5
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:27,046
go start hacking away on these resources out there and help us grow the Active Directory resources.

6
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:33,046
Now try it yourself. There's the URL, github.com/goateepffe/azurerm.

7
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,046
You just go out there. You can download that

8
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:42,046
one calling script file, you can tweak the parameters, the names of things, whatever, and then just run it

9
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:47,046
and you're done. It'll spin you up an environment. Just like we did right here, you can do it yourself.

10
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:52,046
And then, once you've got those files, just start editing and playing with them and make it work for yourself.

11
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:58,046
Question? How do you set the holes cache on the second disk to _____?

12
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:03,046
I didn't have to because over here in my

13
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:10,046
azuredeploy.json, it does all that for me. Let's see if it actually, it doesn't show that.

14
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:21,046
Let's see if it's got adDataDisk and the adDiskSize, somewhere in this long JSON template, it's set all

15
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:24,046
that for me and that's the thing I like about these JSON templates.

16
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:29,046
I don't have to know all that Azure business, alright. I just deploy the template and it builds it all for me.

17
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:33,046
At the end of the day, I blow it all away and I don't care. So it's that easy.

18
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:36,046
Yeah. And let's see, we're

19
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:41,046
still deleting that group. And so now, one last

20
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:47,046
favor I have to ask. Did anybody have to beg your boss to come to this event?

21
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:52,046
Alright, so like, yeah I know it's like, you know, funding travel, budget, conference, all that stuff.

22
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:56,046
Training budgets are really hard to come by. Well I kind of have to do that with my bosses too, so if you

23
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,046
could send me a tweet

24
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:02,046
@GoateePFE and just let me know was this helpful. Is this something that you're going to use?

25
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:07,046
How can you see some impact in your environment? That'll help me sell my boss on coming back next year.

26
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:11,046
Alright, appreciate it. Alright, yes. Would you like a copy of the emails?

27
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:14,046
Oh yeah, I'll take a copy of the emails. Thanks. When they come in, I'll send them.

28
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:20,046
Alright. So we've got about two minutes left here for questions.

29
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:25,046
First off, was this helpful? Yes. Alright, good.

30
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:32,046
Alright, so now you've seen what DSC looks like for Active Directory, and on top of that, now you can spin up

31
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,046
a domain controller to bang on.

32
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:42,046
Now this is just the scratching the surface here. You can deploy multiple machines with this.

33
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:49,046
You can deploy 10 domain controllers and you know build it all out with different roles and all that and you

34
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:52,046
could even, you know, kick off some other scripts to configure your environment.

35
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:58,046
We don't have resources available yet to set FSMO roles and things like that, so we need help building those,

36
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:05,046
so help us with that. Yes, question. Is there a similar infrastructure to the AzureRM if you're hosting locally?

37
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:12,046
Like on Hyper-V? Is there a similar equivalent set of cmdlets likeâ€¦

38
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:20,046
Right, like if you've got a DSC template that you want to spin off of a VM in Hyper-V.

39
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:25,046
For Hyper-V, not necessarily. We have some Hyper-V resources that you might be able to, but you couldn't

40
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:31,046
do it exactly this way. Now you might check, keep an eye on Azure Stack when that comes out for onsite,

41
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:36,046
you'd have your own private cloud stuff, see if that might work with the AzureRM cmdlets.

42
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:42,046
I don't know. I can't make any official statements. I don't know what's happening there.

43
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:53,046
Other questions. Yes. Do you know anybody using the Active Directory DSC stuff for like production systems

44
00:03:53,046 --> 00:04:02,046
like for users and stuff like that? I haven't heard of anybody using this much in production systems yet.

45
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:08,046
It would be kind of one of those things you'd only want to set it once with just the install, right,

46
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:13,046
so apply only for your LCM, right? That's what I just offhand I'd heard somebody.

47
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:19,046
I don't know if it was at the summit last year or somewhere else and someone had said and referenced to

48
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:26,046
to Active Directory DSC for like user provisioning and some OU provisioning and stuff like that where it was apply only.

49
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:30,046
They weren't using it to build like refresher _____.

50
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:35,046
Yeah, you could do that, but I just don't know if that's practical.

51
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:39,046
I mean, you can just run one line of script to create a new user OU group anyway.

52
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:45,046
Why would you do that with DSC? And somebody was asking me this last night and I thought, well, you know for

53
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:53,046
me, I support Active Directory, so all day long I'm standing up AD test environments just to beat on and

54
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:57,046
script against, so for me, this is really handy. I could run this all the time now.

55
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:02,046
And for you guys out there where you need a test environment, you don't have to go through all your VM

56
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:07,046
requests, you know, act of congress, you could just spin one of these up and then destroy it at the end of

57
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:12,046
the day, so. Alright, we're out of time. Thank you all for coming and please fill out our email.

58
00:05:12,046 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you.
