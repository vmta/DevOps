Okay. Active Directory Desired Stake Configuration. How many of you have Active Directory in your environment?

2
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:24,5
Oh, nice. Alright, you came to the same place, alright? How many of you have an Active Directory test lab

3
00:00:24,5 --> 00:00:30,5
in your environment. Nice, alright. That's better than average.

4
00:00:30,5 --> 00:00:35,5
You guys are above average here. How many have Lamas in your data center?

5
00:00:35,5 --> 00:00:38,5
Two, alright I'm not going to talk about Lamas in a data center.

6
00:00:38,5 --> 00:00:44,5
Alright, let's talk about Active Directory in DSC. That's my stuff up there, GoateePFE.

7
00:00:44,5 --> 00:00:48,5
If you search anywhere online you'll find me. Alright, let's dive.

8
00:00:48,5 --> 00:00:56,5
And yes, thank you, applause to all the guys who made this possible for the last 10 years.

9
00:00:56,5 --> 00:01:06,5
Okay, here's the problem. I'm a Microsoft Premier field engineer, and I visit premier customers and help them

10
00:01:06,5 --> 00:01:11,5
with their Active Directory, that's kind of what I've done for years, and most of those customers do not have

11
00:01:11,5 --> 00:01:17,5
an Active Directory test lab. So what I'm going to show you today is how to spin up your own Active Directory

12
00:01:17,5 --> 00:01:24,5
test lab in 30 minutes. Alright, that's mostly just wait time. It takes you just a minute to run the script.

13
00:01:24,5 --> 00:01:29,5
It's going to be about 30 minutes and you're going to have your own domain controller spun up in Azure that

14
00:01:29,5 --> 00:01:36,5
you can just destroy, do whatever you want to against it, and then at the end of the day, just delete and you're done.

15
00:01:36,5 --> 00:01:42,5
So you can have an on-demand domain controller to beat up anytime, just run the script.

16
00:01:42,5 --> 00:01:44,5
That's what we're going to do today. Does that sound like fun?

17
00:01:44,5 --> 00:01:46,5
Yep. Alright.

18
00:01:46,5 --> 00:01:53,5
So that was my goal then. I wanted to be able to deploy an Active Directory test lab to Azure including,

19
00:01:53,5 --> 00:01:58,5
because you know this DSC stuff, usually somebody just spins up a server, but I want to actually put OUs,

20
00:01:58,5 --> 00:02:05,5
and in those OUs, I wanted users and groups, and I wanted to enable the AD recycle bin, here do some AD

21
00:02:05,5 --> 00:02:11,5
configuration, and then I want it to be as simple as running a script and I did not want to have to open

22
00:02:11,5 --> 00:02:13,5
Visual Studio

23
00:02:13,5 --> 00:02:18,5
because I'm not a big Visual Studio person, right. I'm an infrastructure guy.

24
00:02:18,5 --> 00:59:59,999
I don't do---I'm an ops. I'm not a dev on that side of that equation.
