1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,4
Let me show you my config, and we're going to run it, and make a pull server.

2
00:00:04,4 --> 00:00:09,18
Does that sound like a plan? Yes. Alright, I'm not going to show you the simple one,

3
00:00:09,18 --> 00:00:13,18
I'm going to give you the advanced one, why, because I think you're advanced.

4
00:00:13,18 --> 00:00:20,18
You get both, but it's the advanced one. I'm a web guy, so I'm real anal about web servers

5
00:00:20,18 --> 00:00:27,18
and web servers are under constant attack. So here's what I do is I want to configure my pull server,

6
00:00:27,18 --> 00:00:30,18
which is a web server, with the most minimal components possible.

7
00:00:30,18 --> 00:00:36,18
I also want something that nobody else seems to like to set up. My boxes are all core.

8
00:00:36,18 --> 00:00:42,18
There's occasionally when a web server needs to be managed from the iNet management tools like a developer or

9
00:00:42,18 --> 00:00:48,18
something like that. You have to turn on and enable remote management on web servers.

10
00:00:48,18 --> 00:00:53,18
On core, you can't do it because you can only do it through the graphical.

11
00:00:53,18 --> 00:00:59,18
I need you to think that through. You can't turn on remote management because it requires the graphical on

12
00:00:59,18 --> 00:01:05,18
the box to turn it on. Well why can't I turn it on remotely with the graphical?

13
00:01:05,18 --> 00:01:13,18
Because it's not turned on. Well how am I going to turn it on? I wrote you the PowerShell code in DSC

14
00:01:13,18 --> 00:01:18,18
format that does it. I figured it out. So I'm going to show you how to turn on remote management.

15
00:01:18,18 --> 00:01:23,18
Nobody's pull server configs has this in it, so here's what happens.

16
00:01:23,18 --> 00:01:28,18
You can't manage the damn thing after you get it set up. Isn't that stupid?

17
00:01:28,18 --> 00:01:31,18
So do you want me to give you the good code or the bad code? Good code.

18
00:01:31,18 --> 00:01:36,18
Okay, I like that. I'm up for good code. So here's what we do.

19
00:01:36,18 --> 00:01:43,18
This is called the config data. I separate my configuration data from my actual configuration.

20
00:01:43,18 --> 00:01:51,18
So what I'm allowed to do here is I can put in all of those things as properties right here at the top if I

21
00:01:51,18 --> 00:01:56,18
want to change them. If I want to have multiple pull servers, which we'll talk about in a minute, I can just

22
00:01:56,18 --> 00:02:02,18
have multiple hash tables here with different computer names in it.

23
00:02:02,18 --> 00:02:07,18
Now what I'm setting up is roles. I've got a web role and then a pull server role.

24
00:02:07,18 --> 00:02:12,18
So here's all my configuration data. Take a look at this, this is how I get the certificate thumbprint.

25
00:02:12,18 --> 00:02:24,18
I Invoke-Command to the box that has the certificate, Get-Childitem to the store, I find the certificate with

26
00:02:24,18 --> 00:02:30,18
a Where clause if it stays lit, and then I grab the thumbprint. This is a great piece of code, man.

27
00:02:30,18 --> 00:02:36,18
You want this code. This is a great piece of code. So down here, here's how this works.

28
00:02:36,18 --> 00:02:41,18
This is the actual configuration itself and I want you to take a look at the line, I import the DSC resources

29
00:02:41,18 --> 00:02:45,18
that I need, but I want you to look at the line AllNodes.where Role -eq Web.

30
00:02:45,18 --> 00:02:47,18
That's how you separate your configs for the

31
00:02:47,18 --> 00:02:52,18
different roles that you want. This makes it real convenient because once I've written this correctly,

32
00:02:52,18 --> 00:02:58,18
I never want to touch this code here again. The only thing I ever want to touch are the values in the config

33
00:02:58,18 --> 00:03:03,18
data at the top. So I made this much better for everybody. And here's the other thing I did, and I'm not

34
00:03:03,18 --> 00:03:06,18
going to make you try to watch the blinky thing.

35
00:03:06,18 --> 00:03:11,18
I'll tell you about it and you'll see it here. When you install a web server,

36
00:03:11,18 --> 00:03:18,18
you install a Windows feature web-server. It installs a limited set, a matter of fact, just enough stuff so

37
00:03:18,18 --> 00:03:22,18
that you can have an HTML Page. No code will run all that kind of thing.

38
00:03:22,18 --> 00:03:26,18
Microsoft thought that would be a brilliant idea and they're absolutely correct.

39
00:03:26,18 --> 00:03:34,18
So what I do is I do that, but you still need some components for the pull server, so I install those,

40
00:03:34,18 --> 00:03:40,18
but here's the thing, that basic set that it installed, there are things in there I don't want on my pull server

41
00:03:40,18 --> 00:03:46,18
and I want to reduce the attack surface as much as possible. So not only do I have Windows feature resources

42
00:03:46,18 --> 00:03:54,18
that are adding in individual components, I'm also removing the stuff I don't want that the default installed.

43
00:03:54,18 --> 00:04:00,18
This gives me the tightest web server with the least amount of tax surface possible.

44
00:04:00,18 --> 00:04:06,18
They don't do this if you use their sample documentation. They just go blah and it just barfs out.

45
00:04:06,18 --> 00:04:11,18
I'm anal about this because I know it will be a and also this web role is what I use for all my web servers.

46
00:04:11,18 --> 00:04:18,18
It's always the most minimum cut down for them and just the application components like ASP.NET 4, 5,

47
00:04:18,18 --> 00:04:23,18
that it needs to run the applications. So what I here as this thing is blinking on and off is

48
00:04:23,18 --> 00:04:32,18
a list of each one of those. So it's a detailed list, it'll come back, don't worry, you're not missing anything.

49
00:04:32,18 --> 00:04:40,18
So pretty long list, but really cool. Let me get to the cool part.

50
00:04:40,18 --> 00:04:42,18
GUI remote management, as soon as it comes back up. See the light?

51
00:04:42,18 --> 00:04:47,18
Oh, no, of course you don't because it's not up long enough. I just give you…

52
00:04:47,18 --> 00:04:51,18
So what I did is I figured out, I did this actually a long time ago through just regular PowerShell scripting.

53
00:04:51,18 --> 00:04:57,18
I figured out how to enable and configure the remote management piece on IIS without being on the box.

54
00:04:57,18 --> 00:05:03,18
You can do it in a script, but I put it in DSC format. So you have to install the window, the web management service.

55
00:05:03,18 --> 00:05:08,18
The problem with this is that once you install the service, you still have to enable remote management and

56
00:05:08,18 --> 00:05:12,18
then configure it. Those are done through the registry keys. I figured out the registry keys.

57
00:05:12,18 --> 00:05:18,18
Now the registry keys don't exist until you install the management service, but then they exist, so you have

58
00:05:18,18 --> 00:05:22,18
to make sure you get them in the right sequence. Please

59
00:05:22,18 --> 00:05:28,18
flip back on. You can look at the code when you download it. There's the remote management stuff when it

60
00:05:28,18 --> 00:05:33,18
flips back on and the registry keys for it to enable it, get it set up.

61
00:05:33,18 --> 00:05:39,18
The other thing is with remote management on IIS, there's a service that has to be started called the WMSVC service.

62
00:05:39,18 --> 00:05:44,18
There's a problem. I love this problem. This problem makes me so happy.

63
00:05:44,18 --> 00:05:46,18
The service is not started. You guys know how to start a service.

64
00:05:46,18 --> 00:05:52,18
You can remotely do a Start-ServiceWMSVC. But here's the problem.

65
00:05:52,18 --> 00:05:57,18
The service is set to manual, so when the box reboots,

66
00:05:57,18 --> 00:06:02,18
guess what isn't working. The remote management stuff doesn't work and you can't get to it again.

67
00:06:02,18 --> 00:06:12,18
I love that! So what I did is I used a service resource to set it to run and configure it for automatic.

68
00:06:12,18 --> 00:06:18,18
Yeah. So that way it will always be there. Okay, cool. Well let's run this.

69
00:06:18,18 --> 00:06:24,18
Oh, let me go just show you down here. Here's the pull server and what I did is I replaced all those properties

70
00:06:24,18 --> 00:06:30,18
I did in the config data as variables down here, so I never have to touch this code again.

71
00:06:30,18 --> 00:06:36,18
This code is good code. It puts things in the right place, unlike the sample that's out there.

72
00:06:36,18 --> 00:06:42,18
So you should applaud that I gave you good code instead of bad code because Richard Siddoway gives you bad code.

73
00:06:42,18 --> 00:06:53,18
No, I'm just kidding. Okay, so let me run this and what'll happen here is it'll create a MOF and I'm going to

74
00:06:53,18 --> 00:06:57,18
push this to the pull server. Well why can't you pull it to the pull server?

75
00:06:57,18 --> 00:07:02,18
Because I don't have a pull server yet. And I'll show you, I'll let you see this as it runs.

76
00:07:02,18 --> 00:07:07,18
I'm going to, I'm also going to change the LCM on the pull server.

77
00:07:07,18 --> 00:07:10,18
You don't actually need to see this. This is just because I'm weird.

78
00:07:10,18 --> 00:07:23,18
(Audience comment) Yeah, shut up. But here, let me… I'm going to kick off the configuration, so I'm going

79
00:07:23,18 --> 00:07:26,18
to hit this and it's going to push it out, it's going to run the config.

80
00:07:26,18 --> 00:07:30,18
It's only going to take it a couple minutes, but what's going to happen here is I want you to notice what I'm

81
00:07:30,18 --> 00:07:34,18
doing right now. What am I doing right now? Talking to us, jazz hands.

82
00:07:34,18 --> 00:07:41,18
Jazz hands! That's awesome! Nothing. In other words, I'm a big fan of I don't like to work hard,

83
00:07:41,18 --> 00:07:45,18
so I'm going to let this thing do it. Now here's the best thing about it.

84
00:07:45,18 --> 00:07:50,18
If I need a second pull server, what am I going to do? (Audience Answer)

85
00:07:50,18 --> 00:07:57,18
Yeah. I may not even really, other than the name, I may not even need to change anything else, just push it out.

86
00:07:57,18 --> 00:08:05,18
If I need 50 pull servers, which you would never need, I could just fire it to 50 machines all at once if I wanted to.

87
00:08:05,18 --> 00:08:12,18
This is a beautiful thing, man. It's beautiful! It's really, except you can't see it, but it's getting to be beautiful.

88
00:08:12,18 --> 00:08:20,18
And once this pull server comes up, he'll be in full operation. Now all you need to do is start putting your

89
00:08:20,18 --> 00:08:25,68
configs and resources up and that's the hard part and that's my session that I hope the screen stays on the

90
00:08:25,68 --> 00:59:59,999
entire time on I think Wednesday.
