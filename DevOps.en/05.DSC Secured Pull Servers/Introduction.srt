1
00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:16,16
So here's the thing. We're DSC is for configuration management.

2
00:00:16,16 --> 00:00:21,21
I've got two sessions during this week. This is on how to make a pull server for your infrastructure where

3
00:00:21,21 --> 00:00:25,25
you will put your configurations and your resources.

4
00:00:25,25 --> 00:00:29,29
The next session that I'm doing is how to package your configurations and your resources.

5
00:00:29,29 --> 00:00:32,32
These sessions have nothing to do with writing configurations in your resources.

6
00:00:32,32 --> 00:00:39,39
That was yesterday. Now do you want the good news or the bad news?

7
00:00:39,39 --> 00:00:46,46
Bad news. Oh, pessimist. Bad news is this, if you don't know anything about DSC, this is the deep end of

8
00:00:46,46 --> 00:00:55,55
the pool, sorry. Now do you want the good news? Yes. Good news is this, you want the code from yesterday?

9
00:00:55,55 --> 00:01:05,65
Yes. I'm going to give you the code from yesterday. Yay! Which includes the code that I'm using today and

10
00:01:05,65 --> 00:01:09,69
the code that I'm using later in the week and all of the code that we did yesterday, which could show you how

11
00:01:09,69 --> 00:01:11,71
to do DSC.

12
00:01:11,71 --> 00:01:18,78
So first of all, guys, when this thing decides to come back on, look 10 years of PowerShell, yeah!

13
00:01:18,78 --> 00:01:23,83
You're going to see some of these people walking around here and there's going to be Microsoft blue badges

14
00:01:23,83 --> 00:01:29,89
everywhere, so say hi and talk to people. Alright, look fast for when it blinks,

15
00:01:29,89 --> 00:01:35,95
what's going to come is there's the link to the code. It's GitHub at the powershell.org.

16
00:01:35,95 --> 00:01:41,101
There it is, get it quick. Use your camera. Also, you want Steven Murawski's reading list on DevOps.

17
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,105
It's an excellent reading list.

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,110
Okay, you don't look impressed. Alright, let's talk about pull servers.

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,115
Here's what we want to do. We want to have a configuration that we want to be able to send out to other

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,119
nodes that are going to automatically configure our boxes for us.

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,122
We do not want to push this to them because that means I have to manage that.

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:07,127
I don't want to manage anything. I want to sit at home in my underwear and drink coffee or whatever and I

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:14,134
want it managing itself. So we want to bring up a server that we can put our configs on that all of our nodes

24
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:20,140
that are using DSC can go to grab the config for them and automatically do it themselves.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,146
Are you with me so far? Yes. Good. Give me feedback just like that, so I know that you're alive and well.

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,149
And don't worry about the flickering screen. We'll get through it all.

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,152
So does that kind of make sense? I want to have this pull server.

28
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,156
Now there's three kinds of pull servers that you're allowed to have.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,159
Three kinds.

30
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:46,166
I only got three more slides, guys, and then we'llâ€¦ So you can have an SMB pull server.

31
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,169
Here's what an SMB pull server is.

32
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:56,176
Hey, you know what? You guys ever build a file server? Yeah. Do you guys ever create a share on a file server?

33
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:05,185
That's an SMB pull server. Oh, come on. That's all it is. It's a server with a share.

34
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:13,193
So you use though the PowerShell command New-SMBShare to create the share and assign the permissions to it.

35
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:19,199
You can configure the client LCM, which is the local configuration manager to go to that share for the configs,

36
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,203
then delete it and do the right thing. Do not use an SMB pull server.

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,206
You don't have all the features that you need.

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,209
There's another type of pull server called an HTTP pull server.

39
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:38,218
This is a web server. Yeah. It's an HTTP web server, which means all communications go across the wire like what?

40
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:44,224
Plaintext. Plaintext. Not good. Here's why not good. You don't want somebody sniffing those configs

41
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,228
and understanding how you're configuring your boxes. That's not good.

42
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,231
So you can configure an HTTP

43
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,235
pull server, but then delete it and do the right thing.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:04:00,240
Are you ready for the right thing? You only have one right option.

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
HTTPS. There you go! Oh, man

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:07,247
I love it when you play along. So what this means is, has anybody here ever set up

47
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:14,254
a website with a certificate on it. Awesome! That's all we're going to do.

48
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:20,260
Now, the cool part about this is, you have some help in making this work and we're going to go to code here

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,265
in a minute and I'm going to show you how this sets up. It's not difficult and I'm giving you all the code,

50
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,270
so there's no reason why you can't do this at home. Here's what I recommend and I recommend this all the

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:38,278
time when we talk about DSC. I do not develop DSC by pushing it those configurations to machines.

52
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:44,284
The reason is that I need to see the whole process. If you come to my next session on this, it gets complicated

53
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:53,293
fast, and so I always, even in a lab environment, set up a pull server, an HTTPS pull server because it's free,

54
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,298
and in my lab environment, I go through the whole process of development, so it's always correct.

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:59:59,999
So I'm going to give you how to build this pull server. It's really easy.
