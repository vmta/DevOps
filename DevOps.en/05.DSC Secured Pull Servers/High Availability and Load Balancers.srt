1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,579
But I want to talk about high availability.

2
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:05,579
This pull server, as you'll see he'll come up, he'll be a working pull server.

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:14,579
It'll be nice. Is this machine critical? Yes. This pull server is going to hold all of the configurations

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:22,579
for all your nodes. Is it mission critical? It might not be because…

5
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:26,579
Well that's a way to split in the middle and not have a viewpoint.

6
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,579
If the pull server's not available, it won't get updates to the config, but it's already got a cache puppy if

7
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,579
the _____ node. Here's the thing. You're absolutely correct. All the nodes, when they get a config,

8
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,579
they copy that config to themselves. They run that configuration.

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:46,579
The only time they actually pull anything down from the pull server again is if you made a change up here.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,579
So I want you to think about it. If this pull server dies, everybody is still doing what they're supposed to do,

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,579
you just can't get any changes out. So is this mission critical?

12
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,579
Absolutely not. So how many pull servers do you actually need?

13
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,579
Yeah, thanks for putting up the right finger on that one. I appreciate it.

14
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:14,579
Now here's the thing. In production, not lab, in production, I'm a high availability freak, so I'm going to

15
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,579
set up another pull server and make it highly available and let me tell you why.

16
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,579
It's not for performance. It's not because it's mission critical.

17
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:33,579
It's because of two things. I'm lazy and it's cheap. So since it's cheap, if one pull server dies, I don't want

18
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:40,579
to have to care at that moment. I might be out drinking, I might be having fun, and I don't want to care about it.

19
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:52,579
It's so cheap, it's free. Yeah. Anybody here ever set up a load balancer?

20
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,579
Yes. Load balancer website. That's all you're doing. So what you do is you bring up another pull server,

21
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,579
you put a load balancer. Now what kind of load balancers can you use?

22
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,579
Well first of all, how many of you have heard of Microsoft Network Load Balancing?

23
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:13,579
How many of you like to use NLB? Well that's a sorry site. NLB doesn't suck?

24
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:19,579
NLB is actually a great load balancer, but it's a layer three load balancer, which means the entire nick has

25
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:26,579
to die before it fails over. When I come to the websites, I want, if the app pull dies, I want it to be able

26
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:31,579
to failover, so I need a layer seven load balancer. I need a big IPF5.

27
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:39,579
Yes. Yes! So I'm going to spend a 100 grand on two of those because you want to load balance the load balancer

28
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:45,579
for a cheap, dirty pull server. That kind of sucks, doesn't it? Now look, if you've got a spare hardware

29
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,579
load balancer lying around that you're not using, go ahead, and use it.

30
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,579
There's nothing wrong with that, but I'm thinking it's kind of overkill.

31
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,579
This isn't a commerce site for my customers. This is my internal pull server.

32
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,579
So I'm going to give you a free piece of software. How much did I say it cost?

33
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:10,579
Free. That works as well as a big IPF5 and here's the deal, I use this in production on commercial websites.

34
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:16,579
I see confused looks. Okay, here's what I need you to do. Stand up.

35
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,579
How much time do I have? Stand up! I don't have a lot of time.

36
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:25,579
Come on! Come on! You sit all damn day! Get up! Richard Siddoway is, of course, he's too much of an

37
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,579
English gentleman to participate in all of this. I want you to do me a favor.

38
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,579
I want you to put your foot upon your chair. I want you to go like this.

39
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:47,579
Put your hand on over one eye, oh come on, put your hand over one eye, and go arr.

40
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:56,579
Arr. Arr. Arr. Alright fine. Now sit back down. Now you'll never forget it.

41
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:04,579
ARR. A-R-R, Application Request Router. ARR is one of the greatest load balancing products in the history

42
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,579
of the world and you don't even know that it exists and I'll tell you why.

43
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,579
You're going to yell at me too when I tell you why it exists and who it exists from.

44
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:18,579
It Microsoft made it. Was it the IIS team that made it? Yes.

45
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,579
It was the IIS team that made that. I'm very, yeah, we're not going to talk about that, okay.

46
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,579
We're not going to go through that whole scenario because I'll say the wrong thing again.

47
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:29,579
You know what's going to happen. There'll be tweets and it will be bad.

48
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:36,579
Application Request Router. Here's how you get it. You go into the iNet Config Manager, you go out to the

49
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:43,579
web platform installer, you search for ARR, you install it, you get a new icon or a new folder in your web

50
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,579
management tools and you drop servers in there, and it'll load balance them just like that.

51
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,579
You can change the algorithms, all that if you want to play with that stuff or you can just drop servers in there

52
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:59,579
and it'll automatically load balance them and it's faster than gas and it works perfectly.

53
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:01,579
I can't believe it was written by Microsoft. No, that's a joke!

54
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:07,579
That's a joke! I was just lightening up. So a free load balancer that doesn't cost you money, that's the one

55
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:13,579
to go through. So to make this highly available, bring up two pull servers, easy to do

56
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:21,579
with this config, and then give it a shot. I'm going to show you how to test the pull server, what it looks like.

57
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:26,579
Now I might need to reboot this because I was removing software in my config.

58
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,579
Oh, it worked. Okay, fine. Yes. When you install

59
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,579
ARR, ARR, would you install it on one of the pull servers or would you keep that on a…

60
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,579
Great question. No, great question. I'm glad, I should've, so let me answer your question.

61
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,579
This is a great question. Where do you put ARR? You treat it like you need a box that you're going to treat

62
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:53,579
like a load balancer, so what you do is you have a separate Windows VM or whatever with IIS on it,

63
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:59,579
that's where you install ARR. That becomes your load balancer. The pull servers are behind that.

64
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:05,579
Those are the things you put into the little folder, their names, and your DNS address points to this guy.

65
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:10,579
Now some people will get ridiculous like me and go well I need to load balance the load balancer.

66
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:18,579
You put in a second ARR box and then use NLB between them is the best way to go.

67
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:26,579
Then it's free, it's awesome, and it works. Yes, sir. (Audience Question)

68
00:06:26,579 --> 00:59:59,999
Yeah, you'll change the IP address to the IP address of the ARR box, you got it.
