1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,398
So ask whatever questions you want to ask in the few minutes that we have remaining

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:09,398
before you get fed. Well, in there just when you all were setting up the modules on the pull server,

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:14,398
the pull server actually went out and got the modules off the internet themselves.

4
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:20,398
Well in my company, IIS servers, unless their customer facing, cannot be web connected.

5
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:28,398
Yep, absolutely. So what you do is you take your workstation, you bring the modules down, and then you just copy them.

6
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:30,398
So I can just pick a folder off of my workstation and drop them in.

7
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:33,398
I work with a lot of government agencies that are in the same way, right.

8
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:35,398
They can't have their machines can't directly access the internet.

9
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:42,398
So all you need to do is bring down your copy and you copy it out the program files modules folder on that pull server.

10
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:45,398
Now I don't want you guys thinking you're going to be deploying resources all the time.

11
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:50,398
The whole point to this pull server is going forward with all your nodes, you're going to put all of your

12
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:54,398
resources, custom resources, all that onto that pull server, those nodes will then pull them down from the

13
00:00:54,398 --> 00:01:01,398
pull server, so the nodes don't need internet access. It's just this initial set you'll need to go out and

14
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:05,398
grab, right, and then put them up there yourself. You can just manually copy them.

15
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:11,398
I've got a script that does that for a customer, just updates versions and boom, boom, boom, so because they

16
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:21,398
have that situation. What else? Oh, come on. Do you want to do Desired State stuff?

17
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:26,398
Do you want to do configuration in Azure? Did you gloss over the certificate that uses certificates on the box?

18
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:31,398
Yeah, in this situation, the certificates on the box; however, I did give you code to do the certificate request

19
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:41,398
from your PKI if you wanted to. If you have ADCS set up and you have the policy stuff set up on your ADCS,

20
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:46,398
I gave you the code, it's commented out, but you can actually just run code to go request the certificate

21
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:51,398
automatically and put it on the box. A lot of people manage their certificates, though, a different way,

22
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:56,398
so I don't usually automate that for a customer because they have some other piece in place.

23
00:01:56,398 --> 00:02:02,398
Their security team does it a different way. The idea is to get a certificate on the box and then we can

24
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:12,398
pull its thumbprint and go. In your other talk, don't you have the ability to encrypt the configurations themselves?

25
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:17,398
Are you going to cover that in here? We actually did that yesterday and it was about credentials.

26
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:22,398
I missed it. You missed it; however, you got the code for it if you download it.

27
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:26,398
And if you want to ask me questions about it offline, I'm happy to talk to you about it.

28
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:32,398
The code takes you through, don't do this because here's your result, plaintext password, don't do this like

29
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:35,398
they say on the internet because here's your plaintext password.

30
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:39,398
Then it says here's how you encrypt it. You're never going to find this on the internet because they changed

31
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:45,398
how to do it. They added in a document encryption type, you have to make a new certificate, you have to add

32
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:51,398
a new EKU for the document encryption type. If you don't do exactly what I have in there, it never going to work.

33
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:57,398
But I wrote it out all for you, so and I'm happy to talk to you about it and take you through it, that kind of thing.

34
00:02:57,398 --> 00:03:02,398
It's changed in WMF5 than what we had in WMF4, so if you see older stuff, I did a lot of older stuff on

35
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:06,398
credentials and all that kind of stuff. It just doesn't work the same way.

36
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:09,398
The process is the same, but you've got to make a change to the certificate.

37
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:17,398
Yeah, but yeah, we do all the credential stuff. Alright guys. Well, you know, I'll hang here and answer

38
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:23,398
questions, but if you want to go potty, pee, or lunch or something like that, please feel free, but I'll stand

39
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:32,398
here for 15 minutes and chit-chat. So you're officially done. Go.

40
00:03:32,398 --> 00:59:59,999
Thank you.
