1
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:10,941
Now when you guys, don't worry, when you guys get the code for this, I'll wait for it, it's going to look like this.

2
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:18,941
You're going to download this thing called DSC, boy that's really irritating, sorry guys, DSCPreCon and you're

3
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:23,941
going to have all of these sections under there of code. The section that we're starting

4
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:31,941
at is section seven. So you got six earlier sections of wonderful code just for you.

5
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:35,941
Okay, don't be so happy about it. Section seven is the pull server, so I'm going to go in there and I'll

6
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,941
show it to you. And here's how I construct everything. You have a demo file.

7
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:47,941
This demo file walks you through the entire process. Ready? Say yes.

8
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:52,941
Yes. Wow, you guys are tough.

9
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:58,941
I'm going to set my directory here. Now here's what I did. I wrote the entire process

10
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:06,941
down for you in a short list so that you can see what the whole process is and then I demo and create the

11
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:12,941
entire thing for you. So here's what I want you to know. Don't panic about this thing flashing.

12
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:13,941
Just get the

13
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,941
concept that I'm trying to convey to you because you

14
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:20,941
have the code and I've written it all out for you. Are we good so far?

15
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:26,941
Good so far. So relax. I'm relaxing. Okay, good. I like that.

16
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:27,941
So one of the first things

17
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:33,941
you're going to need is you are going to need a couple of things right out the bat to make a secured pull server.

18
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:37,941
You're going to need a certificate. Now this pull server is an internal pull server.

19
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:45,941
You can use your own internal PKI to put an SSL cert on it. I never recommend wildcard certs, but if you

20
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:50,941
must, you must. So you can put an SSL cert on the box that's going to be the pull server.

21
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,941
In my case, I'm going to use a box called DC,

22
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:59,941
which happens to also be a domain controller, don't do that in real life, but you can do it in lab,

23
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:06,941
that we're going to turn into a pull server. This gets a little bit complicated because it's not you making

24
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:10,941
a website and putting a certificate on it. We need some special services in there.

25
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:15,941
Microsoft has bundled this for us to make life easier. So the first thing I'm going to do

26
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:21,941
is I'm going to create a DNS record for the pull server. This DNS record is what I'm going to teach all my

27
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,941
nodes how to use, how to get to, to find their configs. I'm going to forget what this is,

28
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:34,941
but it's DSC.Company.Pri, so I'll just add the DNS record. And here's what I want to show you as soon as

29
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:43,941
he's done with that. We need a DSC resource module off of the gallery.

30
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:44,941
The DSC resource module

31
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:48,941
that we need to get is called, and don't write this down because I have it written here, it's called

32
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:56,941
XPSDesiredStateConfiguration. This module gives us a couple of capabilities and some documentation that I

33
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:01,941
want to show you. Now do you want me to give you the truth or the story?

34
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:09,941
Truth. Aww. Because see the story is a nice, easy polite thing and the truth is painful.

35
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,941
Okay, truth it is. Blame him. Blame him. So look,

36
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:19,941
let me show you how to find this module. You can find this module, and I've written it out for you, of course.

37
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:32,941
I'll show it to you. Oh, yes please. NuGet, NuGet, NuGet. Come on, Come on.

38
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:37,941
Snap to it, snap to it, baby. At least I think we're going to find the module.

39
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:43,941
There it goes. That's awesome. No, that's not awesome. There it goes.

40
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:49,941
There. So here's the module XPSDesiredState. I want you to notice the version numbers 3.9.

41
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,941
Friday of last week, it was 3.8.

42
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:55,941
Wednesday of last week, it was 3.7. I'll get back to that in a moment.

43
00:03:55,941 --> 00:04:04,941
But so they're updating it. But you need this on the pull server and the box you're writing the config to

44
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:11,941
make the pull server, so your author box and your target. So

45
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:19,941
here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to get rid of this right now.

46
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:22,941
No, I can't get rid of that. Oh, this is going to cost me... Oh, that's okay, I'll fix it.

47
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:27,941
So here's where, how am I going to do this, I'm going to use install module to install XPSDesiredState.

48
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:35,941
I need another resource module because the way I like to write my configs, install it on my author box,

49
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,941
and then I need to install it on the box that's going to become the pull server.

50
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:44,941
The resources must exist there. So you can see the next command I'm going to run is Invoke-Command on DSC

51
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:49,941
to do that exact same thing. Are you with me so far? Yeah. Yeah, okay.

52
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,941
So we'll do that.

53
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:58,941
In here, I want to show you something. One of the best things about DSC resources is Microsoft gives you

54
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:07,941
some documentation to help you learn how to use the resource. So what I wanted to show you was right here

55
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:15,941
Where that module is getting installed, out here, and I have to change this to 3.9, out here underneath

56
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:22,941
examples, there's a sample of how to set up a pull server. This is really nice of them, right?

57
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:28,941
Don't you think that's nice they give you a sample? Okay, you don't seem all excited.

58
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:33,941
Let me show you a sample. We're not going to do it this way, but.

59
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:41,941
So they give you a sample. This is a configuration of how to set up a pull server.

60
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,941
And here are a couple of things that we need. First of all, we need to have a special Windows feature called

61
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:51,941
DSC service that has to be installed first. When that's installed, now we can start to set up our pull server

62
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:57,941
and I want to show you some of the configuration settings here.

63
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,941
These are things that we have to tell the pull server how to configure its website.

64
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:06,941
I want you to do me a favor and look at, the endpoint name is going to be the website name, what I want you

65
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:12,941
to do is look at port, Port 8080. This is the port that the websites going to run on.

66
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:18,941
Now I want a secured website, so what port should this be?

67
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:26,941
Four four three. Four four three. Does it have to be 443? No. See SSL works on any port.

68
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:33,941
Why do we usually set it for 443 though? (Audience Answer) Yeah because users don't know how to type in

69
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:38,941
colon for whatever and there's no way to communicate, so we make it easy because the browser makes it

70
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:44,941
easiest for us. Here's what I don't like to do. I don't like to set pull servers up on 443 and there's a

71
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:52,941
reason for this. I can teach the LCMs, the nodes, how to get to the pull server by giving them the port number,

72
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:59,941
but I might on this pull server want to set up something else on this pull server like a self-service portal

73
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:06,941
or PowerShell web access, things that I need users to access that are on 443.

74
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:11,941
And here's why and some people will go, do I have any Exchange guys in here?

75
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:16,941
When you set up a KAS box, are you allowed to put any other websites on that KAS box?

76
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:24,941
No, sir. No sir. Don't call me sir. No! I want to tell you something.

77
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:32,941
I want you to think about this. Configurations that you put on this pull server are little tiny text files.

78
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:38,941
Even if you have a 1,000 or 6,000 configurations, they're little tiny text files, do you know what a web server

79
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:43,941
dishes out really well? Little tiny text files. Little tiny text files!

80
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:51,941
You know how well it dishes it out? That millions of people can get little tiny text files from a web server.

81
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:58,941
So I want you to, I want you to, this web server you're building is never going to be doing any real work

82
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:05,941
because your nodes are going to ask for a text file and it's going to go…

83
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:12,941
One of these can handle everything you've got. Everything. So I want you to just kind of think about that

84
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:19,941
for a second because he's not working hard, so I like to put other things, management things, on him to use

85
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:23,941
up that resource a little bit more. Does that make sense? Yeah.

86
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,941
So if you take a look up here, I'm going to leave it at port 8080.

87
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,941
Here's how we're telling it, though, to be a secured website.

88
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:37,941
We need to give it this information. The Certificate ThumbPrint of the certificate and I'm going to show you

89
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,941
how I get that to fill that in. Now I want to point out a couple of other things.

90
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:52,941
ModulePath and ConfigurationPath. This is the physical location on the pull server where you will put your

91
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:55,941
configs and your DSC resource modules.

92
00:08:55,941 --> 00:09:02,941
You can change this. I do not recommend it. In other words, why are you changing it?

93
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:08,941
If you don't have a really good reason, don't do it. I also want to point something else out here.

94
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:17,941
I skipped over the physical path to where the website files reside and when this comes back up, it's missing something.

95
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:22,941
This is wrong. The documentation is wrong. And I don't know if you'll stay lit long enough,

96
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:27,941
but the documentation is wrong. Does anybody find that funny? No.

97
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:34,941
Oh, I find it funny. I find it typical. Oh, typical. It says iNetPub, but it should say iNetPubwww is the

98
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:46,941
location where the physical files are. Don't worry about it. I'm going to give you a config that's correct.

99
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:51,941
The state is going to be started, other than that, let me show you my config, and we're going to run it,

100
00:09:51,941 --> 00:59:59,999
and make a pull server.
