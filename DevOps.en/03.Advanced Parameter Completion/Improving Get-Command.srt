1
00:00:00,75 --> 00:00:05,974
So let's take that kind of to the next level, alright. So now what we're going to do, I want to show that

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:08,974
you can actually

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:14,974
add argument completers to commands that you don't even own, to native commands if you want to.

4
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:18,974
I mean you want to be careful with that, but

5
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:23,974
so I picked Get-Command to kind of pick on. There's you know I---ignore the title, Improve_Get-Command.

6
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:29,974
It actually---Get-Command as what it does is amazing. Alright, there's nothing, I have no faults with that,

7
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:37,974
but it'd seem like it would be a command to kind of pick on to show how you could have completers that depend

8
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:42,974
on other parameters that are being passed in while you're typing on the command-line.

9
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:49,974
So Get-Command, you know, it obviously it has some completion that happens natively, right.

10
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:58,974
So if I type in module and bring this up, this takes a little while, it was able to complete that.

11
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:05,974
It knew the available modules. Now if I type in -Name and hit Space, now this one's kind of funny.

12
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:11,974
I had to hit Ctrl+Space to bring it up and if you look at that icon, that's not the parameter value icon.

13
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:16,974
But still, it provided completion for this and it is filtered on just that module.

14
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:20,974
If I didn't put any modules there, then it should have just had all the commands available.

15
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:28,974
I can do the same thing with -Noun. This time around it looks like its, the default completion isn't doing

16
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:34,974
parameter values, so again you have the blank there and I had to hit Ctrl+Space, but this is still filtered on module.

17
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:39,974
But you can't do something like -ParameterName and try to bring up completions for that.

18
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:44,974
That's not going to work. It doesn't provide ParameterName or ParameterType completions,

19
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:51,974
so we're going to try to fix that. Now we're going to skip over the one that's labeled First try.

20
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:57,974
You guys can look at that later and it's just going to be this exact same completer here, but just with not

21
00:01:57,974 --> 00:02:03,974
quite as much. But what we're going to do, I want to, actually first, before I embarrass myself, we have some

22
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:08,974
helper functions, this wouldn't have worked earlier or later. We have one called ReregisterCompleter.

23
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:09,974
What this is going to do

24
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:16,974
every time we modify that completer ScriptBlock, this things job is to just go in and for every single

25
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:22,974
parameter or not every single parameter, but all of these parameters, it's going to register this completer

26
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:27,974
to the Get-Command command and to each one of these variables, so we'll be able to just, instead of having

27
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:36,974
this foreach, we'll just call Reregister, oops, command. NewCompletionResult, this is just going to be,

28
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,974
this is the helper function and you're going to want to do this

29
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:43,974
probably. Remember how that simple completer earlier turned into something that's not quite so simple,

30
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:49,974
it's got a whole bunch of lines. This makes it so that you can just take a string and send it to

31
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:52,974
New-CompletionResult. It'll figure out if it needs to be quoted.

32
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:57,974
In this case, this is mostly from the TabExpansionPlusPlus module.

33
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:01,974
I did that one thing. This isn't the best practice here. It saved a couple lives for the demo, but this is

34
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:06,974
actually going to take the word to complete into account from its parent scope, you know where it's being called.

35
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:12,974
Just be aware of that if you try to take this and use it somewhere else since you probably don't want to do

36
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:19,974
that in your real helper function, but we'll read that in. So now we're going to come down and here's kind of

37
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:26,974
the neat thing. Since the completer will know the command and the parameter it's working against,

38
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:32,974
you can do something like this where you use the exact same ArgumentCompleter code for something,

39
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:38,974
for one command you can just have the same completer code, and in this case, you know, we have a check in the

40
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:43,974
beginning, this isn't strictly necessary, but if this completer accidentally got registered to another

41
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:49,974
command, we do a little check to see whether or not we should just return without putting any results out.

42
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:54,974
If this accidentally got sent to another command, you don't want to confuse the output with completion

43
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:59,974
results that don't make sense. The next thing we're going to do, we're actually going to call Get-Command on

44
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:05,974
itself and we're just going to splat the fake bound parameters into it.

45
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:11,974
So one thing we're going to do though, whatever the current parameter that's being operated on is,

46
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:14,974
we're going to add a wildcard to that because otherwise, as we're typing a command,

47
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:20,974
if we type -Module and we type three letters of a module in, that's going to mess your completion results up

48
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,974
later when this gets splatted because that would actually splat those first three letters

49
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:34,974
to Get-Command. And then we're going to, depending on what the parameter is, we're going to do something,

50
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,974
depending on what the ParameterName is, we do something a little bit different.

51
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:42,974
So if the current parameter, remember Get-Command has a ParameterName parameter, if its ParameterName,

52
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:48,974
then we're going to figure out whether or not the ParameterType has been specified and if it has,

53
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:52,974
we'll filter on, I mean literally whatever Get-Command returned earlier is stored in this ValidCommands,

54
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:59,974
so we check the parameters dictionary for each one of those and then all the values, we filter them, we sort them

55
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:05,974
alphabetically and get them a unique value and then send it down the NewCompletionResult.

56
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:11,974
ParameterType is pretty similar. We're going to, just in that case, instead of getting the keys off those

57
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:16,974
parameter dictionaries, we're going to get the values and then take their types.

58
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:22,974
And then if it's any other parameter like verb or noun or name or module, we're going to take whatever those

59
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:29,974
ValidCommands results are, whatever the results from a call and Get-Command are, and we're just going to

60
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:35,974
select that property off of the commands. So what should happen…

61
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:41,974
Question. Sure. Do you have a recommendation or idea when you might want to do multiple completers inside

62
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:47,974
of one completer like you're doing versus first string multiple ArgumentCompleters?

63
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,974
Yeah, so the

64
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,974
question was do I have any recommendations on when to do separate completers.

65
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:56,974
In this case, we're taking the exact same one and registering. And it just depends.

66
00:05:56,974 --> 00:06:02,974
You look at it by case by case basis. So in this case, if I were to make a separate one for each one,

67
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:06,974
there would be so much, all the code would be duplicated, except for this switch statement.

68
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:11,974
So in that case, it makes sense, they're all doing essentially the same thing.

69
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:15,974
They're going to call Get-Command with whatever else has been passed

70
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:22,974
and it's just if you look at it and it looks like you're reusing the exact same code over and over again,

71
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:27,974
I would put it into one completer. I don't think it would hurt anything to have a separate completer for each one.

72
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:32,974
I mean, in the grand scheme of things, this is putting everything in a global dictionary that it's not,

73
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:37,974
it's the same amount of work for the PowerShell engine when it goes to look up hey, alright, I've got this

74
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:44,974
command with this parameter, is there a completer available? So it wouldn't have hurt to do them separately,

75
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:51,974
but in this case because the amount of code reuse would be incredibly high, I just chose to throw them into one.

76
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:59,974
Sure. Another question? Is that okay? Yeah, absolutely. So what is that with

77
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:05,974
Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Get-Command? So that's the fully-qualified command name.

78
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:06,974
I mean and

79
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:12,974
to be honest, it's probably, so Get-Command is something, so there's an order of operations or a precedence

80
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:18,974
for different commands, so if I were to make a function called Get-Command, that would actually kind of

81
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:25,974
shadow the real Get-Command because functions are looked up first and I think aliases are looked up before functions.

82
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:31,974
So in this case, this is just a way to say go to the real Get-Command cmdlet.

83
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:37,974
That Microsoft.PowerShell.Core, that's a way that you can access all the core _____?

84
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:53,974
Well so let's do Get-Command Get-Command and let's see somewhere in there, I guess we have to…

85
00:07:53,974 --> 00:08:03,974
(Audience talking) Yeah, I see that. In the middle there. It may have been.

86
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:11,974
(Audience talking) I wonder if it would be, hold on. Nope. So it's available from Get-Command.

87
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:17,974
In a little bit right after here I'll show you how you can actually grab that information.

88
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:23,974
I don't want to embarrass myself anymore up here. So we'll take that completer ScriptBlock and we're going

89
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:26,974
to run the ReregisterCompleter, which took that ScriptBlock

90
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:32,974
and said for Get-Command register this to the Name parameter, to the Module parameter, all that stuff.

91
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:39,974
So now we should be able to come in and we can limit this to a module and we can do name.

92
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:43,974
Now remember earlier the name, this was coming back with command completions, that icon was a little bit

93
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:50,974
different, so this time the completion just popped right up so that shows that it is using our ArgumentCompleter.

94
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:55,974
Let's actually do like -Verb and Add. Now we can come over to ParameterName.

95
00:08:55,974 --> 00:09:03,974
And so, if this is doing its job, any verb in the PowerShell access control module or any command that has

96
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:09,974
the Add verb in the PowerShell access control module, these are the parameters limited just to that.

97
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:17,974
And you can look, there's not that many of them. If we take this and change it and just do ParameterName,

98
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:23,974
you'll see that it took a little bit longer and there are a ton more that come up.

99
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:30,974
Same thing for ParameterType, so we can actually take ParameterName and let's say our Name -ParameterType

100
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:36,974
and you'll see that out of all the commands in PowerShell, again if this things doing its job, then if you're

101
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:45,974
looking at commands with the ParameterName name, then this says all the commands, there is a SwitchParameter,

102
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:52,974
at least one SwitchParameter that has the ParameterName, at least one scale or string parameter and at least

103
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:58,974
one Array String parameter. And actually let's get the counts. So I don't want to cover too much about

104
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:06,974
what's this is just a modified version we use group object under the ParameterName and ParameterType

105
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:12,974
conditions in the switch block, but for the sake of time, I'll just kind of demo what it does a little bit

106
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:17,974
more and you can take a look at it in a little while. But we're at, we're going to add counts to that.

107
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:25,974
So Get-Command -ParameterName, and so now it has counts in there and you know of course I didn't

108
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:29,974
show this, but when you press Enter, it didn't have the count information.

109
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,974
That was we could tell the list to show something different than

110
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:38,974
what was completed. And when you do look at this, it seems like it'd be kind of useful to be able to sort it

111
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:43,974
maybe on the count and you can do that. You can put whatever kind of logic you want in that completer.

112
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:47,974
So if I put logic in that said take a look at that word to complete.

113
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:53,974
Now I ended up doing an exclamation point here because if you do just the less sign, then the completer won't work.

114
00:10:53,974 --> 00:11:01,974
But if I put that in, I told it to change the way you sort it, so now it's sorting by the count, the greatest number

115
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:09,974
of parameters versus the least number. So you can see that all these common parameters obviously show up the most.

116
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:20,974
And these counts should change as we add different things to filter on, -ParameterName and let's this time do

117
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:28,974
it from an ascending order, but you can see all the different parameters.

118
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:33,474
So instead of the 292 or whatever, it looks like we're down to like 24 that have that.

119
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:40,474
And that's just an example of a way to show completers that can take other parameters that are being typed

120
00:11:40,474 --> 00:59:59,999
into account in real time.
