00:00:01,1 --> 00:00:06,758
Alright, so next I want to talk very, very briefly about a different type of completer.

2
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:11,258
Alright, so those were I'm going to call them normal completers or just completers.

3
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:18,758
There's also something called a native completer. Native completers are geared more towards external light executable applications.

4
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:24,758
So it's things that aren't PowerShell commands, but they still have arguments like the net.exe utility.

5
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:30,758
You can use it to start and stop services and to access shared drives and stuff like that.

6
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:40,758
So the big difference from the completion standpoint is it has different arguments that it receives.

7
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:46,758
So when you take a look, we'll do that thing again where we have a little debug log up, and this time we're

8
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:54,758
actually going to, so this is going to output to that debug log, but it's also going to output some completion results.

9
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:59,758
This is geared towards, this is for ipconfig. Its arguments are really, really simple, so I chose it.

10
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:07,758
But the way you tell it that it's a native completer, you call Register-ArgumentCompleter, you give it the

11
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:11,758
CommandName, and in this case, and then you give it a native switch.

12
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:16,758
So with normal completers, the ParameterName is what's required and the CommandName is optional,

13
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:24,758
so I did kind of skip over that. With normal completers, you can actually say anytime you come across a username

14
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:31,758
parameter, I want you to run this completer, and as long as there's not a completer registered for username

15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,758
with a specific command, then that one will win out. It will end up, you can have it to where a certain

16
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:41,758
parameter is always, has a certain completer that gets executed with it.

17
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:42,758
Native completers, though,

18
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:47,758
they don't, it doesn't take parameter names into account, you register it to a command, and then you provide

19
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:59,758
this native switch. Let's take a look at, so now if we call ipconfig and I have to do Tab or Ctrl+Space,

20
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:07,758
but you can see over here, this time we got three arguments. So the first one is the word to complete,

21
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:14,758
which is useful, the second one is the CommandAst, and then the third one is the cursor position,

22
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:15,758
in this case, 17.

23
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:21,758
So you don't get the CommandName included there. You can grab it from the CommandAst.

24
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:29,758
You don't get the ParameterName, again you can determine that yourself, and you also don't get the fake bound parameters.

25
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:33,758
The CommandAst, like I said, if you want to take the time to look into that, you could get all that

26
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:38,758
information out of it.

27
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:47,758
So anyway, in this case, what I did was looking at the CommandAst and counting the number of elements that

28
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:52,758
were here and I don't want to spend too much time on this. Honestly and truly, if you're interested in these

29
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:57,758
native completers, the TabExpansionPlusPlus module, even if you have version 5, if you go take a look at it,

30
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:03,758
they have a lot of native ArgumentCompletion because it gets a little bit crazier because you have with

31
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:09,758
native commands you might have like for net.exe, you have the first parameter determines what your next set

32
00:03:09,758 --> 00:03:16,758
of parameters is and you have all these trees of parameters that end up.

33
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:21,758
But I wanted to mention this because in just a second, we're going to use native completers for something

34
00:03:21,758 --> 00:59:59,999
that they probably weren't intended for.
