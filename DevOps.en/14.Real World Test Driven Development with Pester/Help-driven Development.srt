1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,495
So what I did was to do what Adam Platt calls help-driven development.

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:12,495
I started with my help file, right. I used my help file as my spec for my code.

3
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:18,495
Okay. It's just an easy way to do it and it means that I always have a spec.

4
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:24,495
But what I did was I realized that my help examples are my contract with the user about the behavior of my

5
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:33,495
code, right, and by code I mean scripts or modules. Okay. And when I make that behavioral contract,

6
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:40,495
I as part of that behavioral contract, when I write my examples, I show sample output.

7
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:45,495
That's my expected in my test. We're comparing actual to expected.

8
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:52,495
So I show an example of running my code and showing expected output.

9
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:58,495
So it's very easy to use the help examples as the test spec and the test as the code spec, of course,

10
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:05,495
it supports behavior-driven development and there's a feedback loop because it makes my help better.

11
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:13,495
So for this, I picked what I thought was the simplest possible little example.

12
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:20,495
I used Windows PowerShell profiles, but when I'm testing or doing demos or writing shared code, I disable them

13
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:25,495
because I don't want something in my profile to affect my test or my code.

14
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:33,495
So I had little snippets of code all over the place that disabled my profiles and re-enabled them and then

15
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:41,495
would get the disabled profile, so I didn't freak out and that's the little module we're going to be testing with.

16
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:45,495
So I actually started with a help file. Let me show this to you.

17
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:50,495
We're going to switch around here. Okay. This is PowerShell HelpWriter.

18
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:59,495
I showed it last year. And I started with a help file for a Get-Profile, Disable-Profile, and Enable-Profile

19
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:08,495
cmdlets and they all have these nice examples. Okay, and then I went over here to PowerShell Studio.

20
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:17,495
Do I need to use zoom it, can you guys see? Okay. And I did New, New Module from Help File, I went to my

21
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:33,495
Help Files, and there's my module. Okay. And so what PowerShell Studio did for me was it just mocked up little

22
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:41,495
functions for my help file. Okay. It used the output type because I was careful to specify that and it gave

23
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:49,495
me a little export module member statement at the end and a module manifest, and quite soon, it will also

24
00:02:49,495 --> 00:59:59,999
give you a test file. Okay. So that's basically where I started.
