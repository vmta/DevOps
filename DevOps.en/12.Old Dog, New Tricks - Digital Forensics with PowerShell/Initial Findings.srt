00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,186
initial findings. There's some sort of brute forcing sqlmap.

2
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:05,186
If you look at the referrer, there's a bunch of sqlmap references.

3
00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:12,186
These webshells were created. Probably didn't need to do that. One thing, another thing that I've found

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:27,186
that's kind of cool is this gourse is kind of a visualization tool, and so okay I've got to figure out where

5
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:39,186
that thing is, there we go. This is a pain in the butt. Anybody see where my mouse is, alright.

6
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:44,186
Alright, so gourse is a visualization, so basically, I took that timeline and created this visualization to

7
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:50,186
show us files that are being created, changes to the file system, and so as you can see, some stuff is happening

8
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:55,186
down there, right. Something happened that is probably not good.

9
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:59,186
That's that brute force with all the session files being created.

10
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:03,186
And then we see over here in this, we see like webshells.zip and c99.php.

11
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:09,186
It's just kind of a way to visualize the data as it's happening.

12
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:15,186
I've got to find my mouse again here. Hopefully, this

13
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:18,186
works. Oh, man. That's oh well.

14
00:01:18,186 --> 00:59:59,999
We're going to do it from here just like this. Okay, so
