1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,439
So when I think about the growth

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:20,439
areas in this, I especially look at DSC and PowerShell classes. Being able to create resources and implement

3
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,439
DSC and be able to leverage those relationship maps

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:32,439
in order to ensure consistency in the environment. Or the other way around.

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:42,439
DSC is setting the configuration and you just pulled the information from the DSC MOF files.

6
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,439
Because when you still have to go out and do things and identify what's happening and where it's going,

7
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:55,439
DSC isn't going to do everything at this point. We're going to get to a place where DSC is capable of

8
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,439
managing multiple layers of the stack, but I was only able to find

9
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,439
Cisco UCS that had a DSC resource outside of what Microsoft was delivering.

10
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:14,439
Are there any others that you know of that Microsoft has not delivered?

11
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:22,439
Yeah, so that's kind of what I thought too. And I also think from a growth standpoint, as we continue to see

12
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,439
people move away from snap-ins and go more towards modules, it gives you an opportunity, as I mentioned earlier,

13
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:37,439
to kind of extend this out a great deal, right, to be able to do more in the environment just directly from

14
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,439
whatever system that you want. You don't have this cumbersome installation process and managing all of those.

15
00:01:43,439 --> 00:59:59,999
You just simply make sure that the module is loaded.
