My name is Josh Atwell and I am here to talk to you about managing your infrastructure stack with PowerShell.

2
00:00:19,19 --> 00:00:26,26
Little disclaimer, I'm not going to show you a bunch of code. I'm not going to teach you how to use a cmdlet.

3
00:00:26,26 --> 00:00:31,31
I'm not going to show you clever little things that I've done with PowerShell.

4
00:00:31,31 --> 00:00:33,33
That's not entirely true. I'll show you a couple of little things.

5
00:00:33,33 --> 00:00:40,40
But what we're going to talk about today and this is something that I very much want you to be engaged with me,

6
00:00:40,40 --> 00:00:45,45
point out where I have gaps, and expand on this. This is a conversation starter and we're going to talk

7
00:00:45,45 --> 00:00:51,51
about a lot of the challenges and the capabilities of PowerShell when you look at the total infrastructure stack.

8
00:00:51,51 --> 00:00:56,56
Okay? If you're on Twitter, I highly encourage you to use the PowerShell Summit hashtag.

9
00:00:56,56 --> 00:00:57,57
You can mock

10
00:00:57,57 --> 00:01:01,61
me and heckle me all you want. That's fine. I'm accustomed to that.

11
00:01:01,61 --> 00:01:08,68
Throw it on Twitter and we'll have some fun with it and I just thought POSHit was just a fantastic hashtag

12
00:01:08,68 --> 00:01:11,71
for so many reasons, so I threw it up there. You can use it or not.

13
00:01:11,71 --> 00:01:17,77
I'm good either way. But as I said, I'm Josh Atwell. I'm a developer advocate at SolidFire, which is now

14
00:01:17,77 --> 00:01:19,79
part of NetApp.

15
00:01:19,79 --> 00:01:27,87
And we have the big thanks to people. How many people were using PowerShell right at the very beginning?

16
00:01:27,87 --> 00:01:33,93
Throw your hands up. Alright, how many started with version 2? And how many of you do not like raising your

17
00:01:33,93 --> 00:01:39,99
hands during presentations? Excellent. I like to _____ my audience and make sure that I don't count any

18
00:01:39,99 --> 00:01:44,104
of your lack of votes. You guys are boring. I'm just kidding. I'm not name calling here.

19
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:49,109
So thanks to those folks. So a little bit about me and I have two hours, so I'm going to talk about myself

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,115
as much as possible. I'm kidding there too. But there's some things that I think are really important before

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:02:03,123
we get started so that we can level set on why this topic was something I submitted an I thought we should talk about.

22
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:09,129
I started out my career working for a small civil engineering firm where I did desktop support and then server

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,133
support and started virtualization. It's where I got started with PowerShell.

24
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:19,139
My intent was to automate some tasks. It started with Exchange and I think a lot of people who got started

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:25,145
early on, Exchange was that first integration that they worked with, right, I mean

26
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:33,153
can I get an Amen? Right. That was when Microsoft really legitimized PowerShell as a tool that you should invest

27
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:39,159
time and energy in and I did that. And VMware then released the vi toolkit and we're going to get into a lot

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,164
of these integrations here in a minute, but as part of this narrative, it's important to understand that

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:50,170
once the VI Toolkit became a thing, now there was this opportunity to do something much broader and much

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:57,177
more impactful in the environment than simply managing my mailboxes and accounts and all that stuff, right.

31
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:06,186
So that took me into CARQUEST general parts where I was responsible for basically rearchitecting the virtual

32
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:11,191
environment and enabling the development team, right. How do I speed up their efforts?

33
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,195
We have this really interesting thing we call today called DevOps, right.

34
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:22,202
This was something, and Luc and I've had a conversation on this, DevOps isn't something new.

35
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:28,208
It's something that we've kind of already done. It's just we have new tools and new methodologies to talk about it.

36
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,211
I'll talk about that a little bit more in a little bit.

37
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:37,217
Going into Cisco IT from General Parts, I went from managing hundreds of virtual machines to tens of thousands

38
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:43,223
of virtual machines and in that process, there was an element where

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:52,232
the manager says to me we need to automate, so we don't have to have extra headcount and we need you to do that, right.

40
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:58,238
And when you start looking at an environment that size, you have to take things into consideration that you

41
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,243
don't normally have to consider because you have time and we're going to talk about a lot of those things in

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,247
this session about how you can leverage PowerShell for multiple layers of the data center, some of the

43
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,251
challenges that are associated with that, and then how you address them.

44
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:18,258
And then now I'm at SolidFire. We were recently acquired my NetApp and in my role as developer advocate,

45
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:24,264
I still write a little bit of code from time to time, but I'm primarily focused on getting people together who

46
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:30,270
develop and work with our integrations and work in the infrastructure stack that are trying to solve problems

47
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,274
whether it's DevOps, whether it's just LeanOps and trying to improve your operations regardless of what they're

48
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,279
doing and try to help make them more successful. So I share the things that they do, I elevate the

49
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:46,286
conversation, and I try to get people engaged, which makes doing things like this fun, except for I'm like

50
00:04:46,286 --> 00:59:59,999
oh crap, I need to write some more code.
