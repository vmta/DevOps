00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,992
I don't want to teach you guys cmdlets, alright. Like you guys know cmdlets, you know how to use Get-Help right.

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:08,992
So the next thing that I want to make sure that you're familiar with and introduce and I thought I had a picture

3
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:14,992
on this, but apparently I don't. So I upload up a vin, I'll get connected, and show you how PowerActions work.

4
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:18,992
So PowerActions is a VMware fling and

5
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:24,992
if you go to labs.vmware.com/flings, search for PowerActions, what PowerActions allows you to do is you

6
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:34,992
install it in your vSphere WebClient, and once installed, it provides a PowerShell console in the vSphere WebClient.

7
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:41,992
Now it's powered and backed by a server, a Windows Server that's running PowerShell, but what it does is it

8
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:48,992
enables you to execute PowerShell directly through the VStore WebClient and the screenshot that I thought was

9
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:52,992
here was a beautiful representation of this, so we'll get that in a minute.

10
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,992
But the other thing it allows you to do is it allows you to create scripts and files, right, that you can

11
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:04,992
share, your create functions that you can share within the VStore WebClient that will allow you to be able

12
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:13,992
to execute against something. Use case for this would be, I don't know about you guys, but when I go into a

13
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:24,992
VStore environment and I see all the storage and there's Datastore, Datastore (1), Datastore (2), Datastore (3),

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,992
Datastore (4), Datastore (5) because every time you install ESXi, it just calls the local disk Datastore.

15
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:38,992
I'm a little OCD. This bothers me. Right. So there's a PowerAction I've created and put out where you

16
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:46,992
right-click on the Datastore and you say set the local name, and it goes out, it pulls ESXi hostname,

17
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:53,992
and renames the Datastore to that name-local. Alright, so now you have logical information.

18
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:59,992
Now that's just an example. You can also do things such as being able to select a network or select a

19
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:06,992
Datastore and be able to query and say what MTU is set up and down the stack, right.

20
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:13,992
It'll check the switch, it'll check the port, it'll check like Cisco UCS and the networking there and you

21
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:18,992
can have that send a report. So if you were in that troubleshooting situation and you remember we had that

22
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,992
full layer, that stack that we had to deal with, this gives you

23
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:28,992
an opportunity to go in and take care of that and get that information and have it embedded directly in the

24
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,992
VStore WebClient, which is a tool that most of us are already using anyway.

25
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,992
Alright, so you're not have to jump around.

26
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:39,992
Everybody going to go check that out? It's not supported, so be mindful where you put it.

27
00:02:39,992 --> 00:59:59,999
It's not officially supported, but it's pretty cool.
