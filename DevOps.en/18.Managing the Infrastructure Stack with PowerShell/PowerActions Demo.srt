1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,603
It's not a good example when it's not working, is it.

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:08,603
Alright, well let me show you the PowerAction stuff as well while we're talking about that.

3
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:12,603
So this is PowerActions as I was describing earlier, so I'll go to Home screen real quick.

4
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:21,603
Once you install it, it allows you to create these scripts that can be accessed

5
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:28,603
directly through the VStore WebClient, and so I've got several of them that I see on a regular basis.

6
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:35,603
Now I'm not a big fan of storage, but I work in storage company, so I talked to a lot of people about storage.

7
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:42,603
So a few things that we run into are like changing queue depth and changing naming,

8
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:48,603
changing performance characteristics, and in order to do that successfully without reaching across silos,

9
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:54,603
if you will, going into a storage team, you have to make that relationship and to do that query.

10
00:00:54,603 --> 00:01:00,603
And currently, it works fine. It just takes longer to actually get all these.

11
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:04,603
And since my other script didn't run, I can't actually show them in action, but I

12
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:08,603
can show you how it works. Here's a PowerCLI Console that I mentioned.

13
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:18,603
It's, well I'm not connected, but it's PowerShell like it just runs.

14
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:34,603
Alright, let's go to this and so when you right-click, say Execute script, and it will tell you what's there.

15
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:39,603
You select which one that you want to run and it will prompt you.

16
00:01:39,603 --> 00:01:46,603
I don't think I can run any of those because the storage is disconnected, but yeah, and what

17
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:54,603
it allows you to do then is to be able to identify or execute things or report back and identify how this

18
00:01:54,603 --> 00:02:00,603
relates to other things like you could have a report that says give me all the snapshot information, give me all

19
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:07,603
the VLANs that are being used that are associated with this host on the Cisco UCS or something like that,

20
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:14,603
make sure that those two match up. Alright, so we've got some customers that are working on doing that.

21
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:22,603
That make sense? I wish I could run it, but I can do the local Datastore.

22
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:29,603
I guess my PowerShell Server is broken. I'm sorry. That's what I get for updating it to version 5 and not

23
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:33,603
testing before the conference.

24
00:02:33,603 --> 00:59:59,999
Sorry about that.
