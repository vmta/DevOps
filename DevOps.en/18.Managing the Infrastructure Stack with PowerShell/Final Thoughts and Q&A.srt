1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,059
Any other questions? Thoughts? Funny stories?

2
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:15,059
So Josh. I noticed on your third slide you had a whole VMware stack and a very popular vRealize orchestrator.

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,059
Yeah. I'm curious. How do you use an orchestrator because we developed and raised PowerShell scripts that

4
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:29,059
makes all these decisions for us and I feel silly for bringing an orchestrator because I've just taken all

5
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:34,059
that logic out and I build it and I run _____ as something stupid like that.

6
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:38,059
Yeah. So how do you use it? Or do you use it and use the dev?

7
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:46,059
Yeah, so I use Orchestrator primarily if there's any decisions that need to make, if there's going to be any

8
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:58,059
branch like if anything will change as a result of a condition or I need to do things like it will change

9
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:04,059
due to a condition. It says that if this condition exists, go this way, if it doesn't, go that way.

10
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:12,059
I tend to use Orchestrator for that. But it also really comes down to with Orchestrator what you have plug-ins

11
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:18,059
for and what you have actions and workflows for and that's where you hit a point and you're like well time to

12
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:27,059
go to PowerShell and then you can call from that. So I've tended towards Orchestrator primarily, and again,

13
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:31,059
anyway I'll talk about the hammer like when you're hammering everything is a nail like I always start with PowerShell.

14
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:36,059
I force myself to use Orchestrator and other tools. The biggest advantage and

15
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:50,059
I didn't show it here, but right here is the same idea, yeah, so that's vRealize Orchestrator is also object

16
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:54,059
aware in the VStore WebClient and it's supported like fully supported.

17
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:56,059
So you can create the workflows right in that, so a lot of the stuff

18
00:01:56,059 --> 00:02:02,059
that I'm talking about, you can do with Orchestrator as well. This is PowerShell conference.

19
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:15,059
But with PowerActions, I like it because it also allows me to do more things because Orchestrator doesn't cover everything.

20
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:21,059
And that's the part that I'm struggling with is that I want to expose something simple to people.

21
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:29,059
Yeah. I don't want it to let them... Yeah, and for me everything is if I can just give you an

22
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:35,059
opportunity to run it and you not care how it's built on the back-end.

23
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:41,059
I tend towards Orchestrator primarily because it's fully supported from VMware and it's not handing someone a

24
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:45,059
PowerCLI script, but if you look at my GitHub repos, it's all PowerShell stuff, right.

25
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:52,059
I haven't released the Orchestrator stuff yet. But we have some customers using it, I just don't, I help them,

26
00:02:52,059 --> 00:03:03,059
but I don't publish it. (Audience comment) Yep, so the primary requirements you have to have a PowerShell

27
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:13,059
Server and when you do the install, you have to make some modifications to the vSphere Virtual Center Server appliance

28
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:17,059
and there's some files that you have to make a slight modification to and there's that modification is

29
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:31,059
just so it will show up in the UI. (Audience comment) I think it's 5.5 is the one with the newer VStore WebClient.

30
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:38,059
So I've run it in 6, I had it running in 5.5. I don't think it's supported in 5.1 because I just don't think

31
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:54,059
that the WebClient functions with it. And then from the PowerShell side, Server 2012, actually I can pull it up.

32
00:03:54,059 --> 00:04:00,059
So it's labs.vmware.com/flings and their site was down the other day for maintenance, so I'm hoping it's back up.

33
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:13,059
It is. Good. (Audience comment) What's that? There we go. So look for PowerActions and it goes right in

34
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:19,059
system requirements, 5.1 is included, so that 1 is included. Alright.

35
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:26,059
Server 2003 or higher, .NET framework 4, and 4.5 and then all the PowerShell versions.

36
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,059
And of course,

37
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:31,059
whatever version that you have. And here's the thing. You have to have all the modules for the different

38
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:36,059
layers in infrastructure onto that PowerShell server, otherwise, it can't run.

39
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:43,059
(Audience comment) No. It'll be separate unless you were running the Windows version.

40
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:50,059
If you're running the Windows version of the Virtual Center Server, it can all be native.

41
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:55,059
I think VMware has made it sufficiently painful to run the Windows version.

42
00:04:55,059 --> 00:05:01,059
I think a lot of people have, they've improved the appliance sufficiently that a lot of people have moved

43
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:08,059
over to that, at least that I'm seeing. Alright, well I guess I'll just close it out.

44
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:13,059
If anybody wants to talk with me after, you'll get a little bit of time back.

45
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:20,059
I hope that this kind of gave you some insight into how PowerShell's being leveraged across the stack.

46
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:26,059
I also hope that when you start thinking about some of the challenges of taking advantage of those, this kind of

47
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:30,059
gets you in that frame of mind. Like I said at the beginning, I don't pretend to have all the answers.

48
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:37,059
I just simply know some of the questions that you need to be asking and wanted to feed some thoughts into how

49
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:44,059
you might tackle those things. And so, once I get that repo out, I'll make sure that I hit the

50
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:50,059
PowerShell summit hashtag when I deploy that out and I'll let everybody know and I'll look forward to your contributions.

51
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:53,059
Thank you for your time and your feedback and your participation.

52
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:59,059
I appreciate it. And despite what my wife says, I don't really feel the need to talk for long periods of time

53
00:05:59,059 --> 00:59:59,999
without people talking back, so thank you for that and I appreciate it.
