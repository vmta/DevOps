1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,512
So let's get into why we would PowerShell the stack, right. I

2
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,512
almost feel like it was challenge that somebody has like can you get Salt N Pepa into a slide?

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:17,512
Yes, I can. So we're going to posh it real good. Alright? And here's the thing, right, why would you use

4
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:25,512
PowerShell across the whole stack? In your environments, let me just ask real quick, in your environments,

5
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:32,512
do you have control over multiple layers of your ecosystem that you could automate with PowerShell?

6
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:39,512
Yes. Right. That's becoming more of the norm. We hear a lot of conversations about silos.

7
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:44,512
Frankly, I don't like silos. I mean, I like the fact that they hold corn and corn is a primary ingredient of

8
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:50,512
bourbon and I'm a fan of that part of it, but when it comes down to organizational structures, I really prefer

9
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:56,512
looking at it as disciplines, right, and when you break down that concept of there being some separation

10
00:00:56,512 --> 00:01:03,512
between you and a peer or how you look at your infrastructure, you now have opportunities to share and

11
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:06,512
contribute with one another. And so I did this poll

12
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:11,512
on Twitter and if you're on Twitter and you want to, go to my profile, it's pinned.

13
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:18,512
You can go ahead and contribute and then I can pull that up at the very end to see how this number changes.

14
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:25,512
But what I wanted to know is how many layers of your infrastructure stack do you manage with PowerShell currently?

15
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:32,512
And I won't lie, I was a little bit surprised to have that many people claiming seven plus layers.

16
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:33,512
Think about that.

17
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:38,512
Seven layers of infrastructure, right. And we'll get into how I define that in just a minute,

18
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:44,512
but seven components, seven layers of your infrastructure managing with PowerShell.

19
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:48,512
You know ten years ago if you would have asked anybody that was getting started with PowerShell if we would

20
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:54,512
be seeing that kind of result, I think that people would be a little bit bearish on that.

21
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:58,512
Jeffrey Snover will probably be bullish on that, as he should be.

22
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:03,512
But I also noted that the majority of people only have about three to four layers that they manage and I

23
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:11,512
think the fundamental element of that is based on what they have access to, right, what they were able to

24
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:14,512
automate and engage with PowerShell because this is

25
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:23,512
what our environments look like, right, and I tried to be heterogeneous if you will and demonstrate there's

26
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:30,512
more than just because I think most everybody here is VMware vSphere, we've got some Hyper-Vs, maybe a couple OpenStacks.

27
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:35,512
Anybody running OpenStack in here? Okay. Have you used the OpenStack PowerShell?

28
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:43,512
Okay, so it exists. Some folks at Rackspace built PowerShell modules for OpenStack, right.

29
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:53,512
And when we look at our ecosystem now, we have a few things that are really prevalent that we have to identify.

30
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:58,512
The fact that we have more layers. It used to be your applications were directly on physical hardware.

31
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:04,512
Alright, and we still see some of that, but we now have a lot more layers, a lot more components and one thing

32
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:09,512
that's really important there is that in that complexity, there's a lot of interdependency.

33
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,512
Anybody carry a

34
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:15,512
pager? Right and there's something that goes wrong. What's the first thing you have to do?

35
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:19,512
You've got to figure out what was impacted. Right, you've got to figure out where it came down to.

36
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:25,512
You're doing your root, you're trying to find out the root cause and what is going on and there's lots of

37
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:32,512
layers that you have to consider before you can identify exactly where the issue is, well unless it's blatant like

38
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:38,512
storage going down or a network just going poof and disappearing, right.

39
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:42,512
But with these additional layers, you have that additional complexity, right.

40
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:49,512
You have dependencies that we didn't have in the past, and so it's really important for us to take advantage

41
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:54,512
of the capabilities from a PowerShell standpoint in order to deal with that.

42
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:59,512
And then finally, another thing that I see in the work that I do from day to day is that

43
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:04,512
our consumption models of our resources is changing fundamentally, right.

44
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:08,512
We are very quickly moving away from this world

45
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:13,512
where someone calls you and asks you to provision something, right.

46
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:20,512
We're moving more to a world where people are enabled to do their own provisioning, they're enabled to make their

47
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:24,512
own changes in their environment. We're delivering IT as a service, right.

48
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:25,512
So

49
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:31,512
what we're seeking now is opportunities to manage at scale and when I say scale, I don't necessarily mean

50
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:38,512
Cisco IT scale, right. Your scale is completely relevant to what you are doing in your environment.

51
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:42,512
So if you only have a 100 virtual machines or you've got 10,000 virtual machines, you still

52
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:48,512
have issues with scale, right. You still have your constraints and the things that you're trying to do and

53
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:55,512
what you're limited to varies, right. We all have our limitations and things that we have to work against.

54
00:04:55,512 --> 00:05:01,512
And then you look at where you have opportunities where you want to implement DevOps methodologies and tools

55
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,512
and you're looking at

56
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:11,512
like this complicated stack and you're saying how do I even get started, like what can I do?

57
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:16,512
How do I start moving towards this and how can I leverage things that I already know?

58
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,512
And we're going to talk about that today as well.

59
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:21,512
And I've already touched on it, right. We want more IT as a service.

60
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:29,512
We want to give people an opportunity to be self-empowered to do the things that they need and not being

61
00:05:29,512 --> 00:59:59,999
completely reliant on submitting a ticket for everything that they do.
