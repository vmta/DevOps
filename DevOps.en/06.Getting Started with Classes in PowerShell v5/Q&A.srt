00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,626
Let's slip back to the presentation. So that was kind of my demo and everything.

2
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:07,626
I want to kind of leave it open for questions. I know there were some in between.

3
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:08,626
Yep.

4
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:13,626
I was wondering about deriving like constructors. Can you do that as well?

5
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:19,626
So like say you had like your base class has got whatever kind of copy or something and a constructor for that,

6
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:24,626
that sets off my properties or whatever, then you want to basically like extend that and add another class

7
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:32,626
with a few more properties. Do you inherit that constructor? In terms of inherit, you would call it from

8
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:38,626
the other constructor. You wouldn't really inherit from it. So you had, just kind of like how I showed

9
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:49,626
before where you call it with that base keyword, so if you had Class2 and Class1, you would actually have

10
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:57,626
to call it with that base keyword where you'd say Class1 base and then call anything in there sort of thing,

11
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:05,626
if that makes sense. Yeah. But yeah. Any other questions?

12
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:13,626
Yep. Probably a great person to ask, do you know if there's ever going to be a merge in Visual Studio code

13
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:20,626
and the ISE? If you were in David Wilson's session earlier today, that's kind of his goal.

14
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:26,626
So I would definitely watch that session when it gets up on YouTube because that's what he talked about.

15
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:31,626
The PowerShell editor services are kind of where everything is heading, so hopefully we're going to have one

16
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:37,626
editor service to rule them all sort of thing. If you actually get the latest preview that's going to be

17
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:43,626
coming out soon, you'll actually be able to say File, instead of New PowerShell Tab, there's a new PowerShell

18
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,626
Experimental Tab and

19
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:50,626
that is actually using the new editor services, so that's a good way that the community can start to test

20
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,626
those editor services. Let me ask you answer your question more directly.

21
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,626
We're not merging the two editors, we're just going to share a lot of theâ€¦

22
00:01:55,626 --> 00:02:03,626
Yeah, okay. Sorry. I didn't realize you were sitting right there.

23
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:09,626
Mission accomplished. Yeah, right. Cool.

24
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:12,626
Cool, well thanks for coming and I

25
00:02:12,626 --> 00:59:59,999
hope you have a great rest of your conference.
