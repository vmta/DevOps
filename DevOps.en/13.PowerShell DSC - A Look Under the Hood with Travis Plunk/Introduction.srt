For the PowerShell DSC, A Look under the Hood. My name is Mark Gray.

2
00:00:17,17 --> 00:00:26,26
I'm a program manager on the PowerShell team. I've been working on DSC since the beginning essentially,

3
00:00:26,26 --> 00:00:32,32
before you guys saw it, so I've been around for a while. I have with me here Travis Plunk.

4
00:00:32,32 --> 00:00:39,39
I'm Travis. I'm a senior software engineer on DSC. I've been working from the beginning.

5
00:00:39,39 --> 00:00:45,45
I've worked on the engine and the Azure DSC extension for DSC.

6
00:00:45,45 --> 00:00:51,51
Alright, so what we're going to talk about today, the format of this first of all is going to be open,

7
00:00:51,51 --> 00:00:56,56
you guys ask questions, it's going to be very interactive hopefully.

8
00:00:56,56 --> 00:01:00,60
Push the button. Thank you.

9
00:01:00,60 --> 00:01:07,67
Jason even came up beforehand and said make sure you push the button.

10
00:01:07,67 --> 00:01:13,73
So it should be very interactive, ask questions, interrupt us, let us know.

11
00:01:13,73 --> 00:01:15,75
We have four things that we are going to dig

12
00:01:15,75 --> 00:01:20,80
into here and then we'll leave it open for questions, so anything you guys want to ask questions about from

13
00:01:20,80 --> 00:01:21,81
a DSC

14
00:01:21,81 --> 00:01:26,86
perspective, let us know and we'll dig in. If we can do demos with the questions, if not, we'll just answer

15
00:01:26,86 --> 00:01:34,94
the questions or what have you. So we're going to talk about a lot of the new features in WMF5, so the encrypted MOF.

16
00:01:34,94 --> 00:01:39,99
We're going to dig into what the purpose of those is, what the good things are, what the bad things are,

17
00:01:39,99 --> 00:01:43,103
all that kind of stuff. We're going to dig into configuration reuse.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:48,108
Nobody wants to write scripts of the same stuff over and over and over and over again.

19
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,113
So in DSC, there are a number of different ways to actually reuse configurations, so we'll kind of dig into

20
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,117
those, what the good parts of it is, what the bad parts, some are good for some things and others are good

21
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:06,126
for other things. And then configuration status. I, as Kevin pointed out earlier on, I came from the GP world,

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:12,132
so one of my big caveats or one of my big things that I have been pushing for since being on the DSC team was

23
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:20,140
we're not going to build a black box from the PowerShell or from the GP perspective.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,145
You had policy and what happened with the policy? I don't know, let's build a tool to figure out what happened

25
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,149
with the policy. It's policy so it should have applied, right? You don't know that.

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:36,156
So configuration status gives you a good look into what DSC did, what the status of it is, and all that kind of stuff.

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:43,163
It's actually a rich set of information in MWF5. So in MWF4, we had some basic information there.

28
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:48,168
We've made that really robust, so it gives you a lot of information, and we'll show you how to dig into that

29
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,172
and see all that information. And the last bit is the pull server 2.

30
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:59,179
There have been a lot of sessions already. All day yesterday was on DSC and pull server and all that kind of stuff.

31
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:06,186
We'll touch on some stuff with that, especially as it kind of relates to Devops and things like that.

32
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:12,192
So we'll dig into that a little bit and some things there and then open it up for questions.

33
00:03:12,192 --> 00:59:59,999
With that I will hand it over to Travis to talk to you about the Encrypted MOFs.
