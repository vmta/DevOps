1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,083
So I've learned a ton

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:07,083
from all the IT professionals that I've had the opportunity to work with and talk to, especially at conferences

3
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:13,083
like this, so I'm really happy to be able to give back a little bit and take what I'm good at, writing code all

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:17,083
day long without breaking a sweat and kind of share some of that with you and some of the things that I've

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:22,083
learned exploring Desired State Configuration. Somebody else that's important for you to meet, the Local

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:27,083
Configuration Manager itself. This is what we're going to be focusing on.

7
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,083
Now I'm going to be assuming, since this is a deep dive,

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:34,083
that everyone's familiar with the basics of DSC and all of those introductory concepts.

9
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,083
However, if you do need to fill in some of the

10
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:42,083
gaps, this morning, Jason Helmick had a great talk. Unfortunately, it's passed, but you can track down the

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:47,083
video for that and there's a link here for the code that he released after his talk.

12
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:52,083
He's also got another one on Wednesday, have the details there. If you are

13
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:57,083
interested in filling in on some of the details, if you're a little light on those, definitely go check those out.

14
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:04,083
He's covering most of what I'm glossing over. What we're going to do today.

15
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:09,083
We are going to make a very quick run through an overview of Desired State Configuration, just touching on

16
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:13,583
some of the points that are significant from the LCM perspective, then we're going to get into the nitty gritty.

17
00:01:13,583 --> 00:59:59,999
So let's jump right into it.
