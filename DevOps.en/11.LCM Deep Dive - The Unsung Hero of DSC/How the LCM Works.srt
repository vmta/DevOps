1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,799
Another really cool thing you can do is make use of partial configurations. These you'll see applied

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,299
in the Meta Configuration that you send to the LCM. So you'll see here we're using this PartialConfiguration

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:18,299
resource to tell the LCM about all the pieces that we're going to be sending it.

4
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:24,299
In this mode, in this example rather, we're using Push mode. So you can use push or pull and I'll show you

5
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:30,299
pull in a second, but this is an example of configuring a Push mode PartialConfiguration, in our case,

6
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:33,299
we have three different pieces.

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:41,299
Some notes about using partial configurations. Once you configure the LCM to expect partial configurations,

8
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,299
you can no longer use Start-DscConfiguration

9
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:48,299
for that normal default operation that we do to send and immediately apply.

10
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,299
PowerShell will yell at you. What you have to do, what they want you to do is to use

11
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:58,299
Publish-DscConfiguration. Just as we saw before, we'll send the configuration over in a pending state.

12
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:05,299
At that point, you can use Start-DscConfiguration with the use existing flag and that will trigger the LCM to

13
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:11,299
check for those pending configurations, suck them in, and apply them.

14
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:17,299
Another really important detail is that the names of your partial configurations matter.

15
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:23,299
Basically, in the PartialConfiguration resource of your Meta Configuration, if you give it name X when you

16
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,299
publish a configuration to it, that configuration must be defined with configuration X.

17
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,299
The names have to match because that's how the LCM knows what you're giving it.

18
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,299
Otherwise, it would just be alright, well now I've got three configurations.

19
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,299
I don't know which ones what. To do partial configurations

20
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:48,299
in pull mode, we see a little bit more complexity. We've now added this ConfigurationID, which is a GUID,

21
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,299
which we haven't seen a GUID this whole time and I was so happy that we don't have to rely on GUIDs anymore,

22
00:01:53,299 --> 00:02:01,299
but in this scenario, we still do. ConfigurationID ties all of your pieces together when you're in pull mode.

23
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:08,299
The rest, pretty similar, we're using again the PartialConfiguration resource and this time because it's pull

24
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,299
mode, we have to tell it where it's pulling from so you have a reference.

25
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:18,299
Just like any other reference that you would see, like if you were doing a dependsOn in any of your other resources,

26
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:27,299
you reference the ConfigurationRepository resource that holds the configuration that you're going to be pulling.

27
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,299
Lastly, you tell it that we're in Pull mode.

28
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:45,299
So quick question. (Audience question) The MOF file that you place on your pull server?

29
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,299
Yep, I'm getting to that right now actually. Here's exactly what it is.

30
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,299
So normally, you'd be able to deploy a pull configuration by just putting the friendly name of your

31
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:59,299
configuration.mof in that ConfigurationRepository folder on your pull server.

32
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:05,299
With partial configurations in pull mode, you have to use a friendly name .configurationid on both the MOF

33
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,299
and the MOF checksum file. So again, this is kind of, you're using your familiar names,

34
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:16,299
but the ConfigurationID ties everything together so the LCM knows alright, well these are all pieces of the

35
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:27,299
same one thing. Does that answer your question? It sure does. Another cool thing about partial configurations

36
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,299
in pull mode, you can actually put the different configurations on different servers.

37
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:37,299
This is one of the really powerful features because if you've got a large organization and you've got different

38
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,299
people in different departments and they all want a shot at your nodes,

39
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:47,299
you can give them their own pull servers. Have them set up their own pull servers so your security team gets

40
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,299
their pull server and I reference that and all the other teams get their own and you can reference all of

41
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,299
them separately, pull the pieces together, and apply one final configuration.

42
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,299
One caveat to that,

43
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,299
oh I guess I get to the caveat later.

44
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,299
It's on this slide. I'll get to that in a second. So partial configurations, we talked about push and pull,

45
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:16,299
but you can also do mixed node. So I can define a Meta Configuration to my LCM and I can tell it well I've

46
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,299
got a partial configuration for you. It's got four parts. This one is pull, this one is push, and these other

47
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,299
two are pull and it works.

48
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:32,299
I haven't been able to think of a use case for it, but I'm sure there is one, so it's very nice that it supports it.

49
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:38,299
As I said, this is great for splitting up large or overly complex configurations to make them a little more manageable.

50
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,299
One of the things I don't care for, although I don't

51
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:46,299
have a better solution, so I'm not complaining is that you have to custom tailor your LCM configuration up front.

52
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,299
Your LCM has to know all the pieces that are coming to it.

53
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:54,299
You can't just say alright well here take this configuration and then a few days later decide well I'll take

54
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:59,299
this one too, but don't get rid of the old one, apply them both.

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,299
You have to know up front all the pieces that you're going to be sending.

56
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:07,299
And here's my caveat, when you have your partial configurations, if they're coming from all over the place,

57
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:11,299
conflict protection doesn't happen until we're applying them all on the node.

58
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:14,299
And if you think about it, that's really the only way you can do it, especially if they're coming from

59
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:21,299
different pull servers, but it is important to remember because it's probably going to be a real pain to debug.

60
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:28,299
In general, when you're making configuration changes to the LCM, important things to remember are a lot of

61
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:34,299
these options are not dependent on one another, configuration mode, refresh mode, they operate independently.

62
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,299
So depending on the scenario

63
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:41,299
you have, you can pick and choose only the pieces that you're really going to need in that case.

64
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:45,299
That flexibility also means you can mix and match those settings to suit your need.

65
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:50,299
Configuration mode and refresh mode have three options each. That's nine different choices that you can make

66
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,299
just with those two options. That leave me to my

67
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:59,299
other recommendation. There are so many permutations of ways to configure the LCM.

68
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:05,299
If you come across something and you're wondering how it's going to work, build it quick in a lab, test it out.

69
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:09,299
That's actually how I got a lot of the information that I needed for this talk, which coming from a software

70
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,299
engineer, it was a lot of fun trying to create a domain

71
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:18,299
and install the certificate authority, yeah, that was fun. But we figured it out.

72
00:06:18,299 --> 00:59:59,999
We got everything and I got all the info I needed.
