1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,844
Now what I want you to think about is I'm sure everybody here is it's a beginner concept filtering left.

2
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:11,844
I mean everybody should know that you want to filter as early as possible in the pipeline.

3
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:19,844
So but when you're working with SQL Server, it may not be a 100% clear what you're doing.

4
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:26,844
So what I can do is actually query a SQL Server database and I'm actually going to do a select * from the person table.

5
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:33,844
I'm going to bring it back to PowerShell and filter it down to the people with the last name of Browning.

6
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:38,844
So I have a list of the users with the last name of Browning. Well I can actually do that same thing inside

7
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:42,844
my SQL code, which is a lot more efficient.

8
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:46,844
It's kind of like some of the Active Directory cmdlets. I mean I think we all know they leave a lot to be

9
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:51,844
desired sometimes depending on what you're doing and depending on the size of your organization and what

10
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:57,844
you're doing, a lot of times you're better off using ADSI. But if you don't know ADSI, then you've got to

11
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,844
use the PowerShell cmdlets.

12
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:04,844
So anyway now I execute this other command and you'll notice it was instant.

13
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:09,844
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to run the first one again and then I'll run the second one as well.

14
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:24,844
Well the first one took 1167 ms. So the second option took 8.1 ms and this is all running on this machine,

15
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:29,844
so we're not having to take into account network latency and all that sort of stuff.

16
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:38,844
So what's the difference? The second command was 21 times faster than the first 1.

17
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:47,844
So what I actually try to do, I try to write all my code in Transact SQL because I want to filter as early as possible.

18
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:53,844
I don't want to bring anything I don't need back to PowerShell and a lot of my knowledge with SQL Server is

19
00:01:53,844 --> 00:02:00,844
actually, when I started working with PowerShell, it just made sense because you don't want to query all these

20
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:07,844
table and pull every column and every row back only to filter it later and it's the same concept as filtering

21
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,844
left with PowerShell.

22
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:15,844
So what I can also do, I can also run store procedures from PowerShell.

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:22,844
So that runs fine. Well there's kind of a caveat here. Not all store procedures will run in PowerShell and

24
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:33,844
not all T-SQL code will run in PowerShell. There's a store procedure called sp_who2 and it's basically the processes.

25
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:40,844
And you'll notice I got an error message. It says that duplicate columns are not permitted because it's trying

26
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:46,844
to pull back two columns with the same name and we can't have two objects with the same name.

27
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:56,844
So what I'll do, let's just copy this. So if I put that on my SQL Server and this is SQL Server on query1.

28
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:04,844
If I execute that, it executes fine. Well the problem is you've got a SPD here and you've got a SPD there,

29
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:11,844
and the reason you've got two SPD columns is they're doing a join, so they're joining on that column because

30
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:18,844
you have to have the same, it may not necessarily be the same name in SQL Server always,

31
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:22,844
but the problem with this, we can't just go modify system store procedures.

32
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:28,844
It's probably not a good idea to start with and even if it works well for a while, guess what, when you apply

33
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:36,844
a service pack, your changes are probably going to go bye-bye.

34
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:40,844
Okay, so what's the solution to that if I really want to run sp_who2?

35
00:03:40,844 --> 00:59:59,999
I'll just write my own.
