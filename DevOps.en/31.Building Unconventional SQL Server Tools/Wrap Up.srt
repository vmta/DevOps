1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,958
This is a resource slide. There's some free stuff. PowerShell.org, the PowerShell Virtual Chapter of SQL PASS.

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:13,958
They do like lunch time meetings. They had one today, matter of fact.

3
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:22,958
SQL Saturday Technology Events. I'm speaking at SQL Saturday Atlanta on May 21 on toolmaking and I'm speaking

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:28,958
at SQL Saturday Pensacola the first weekend in June on Desired State Configuration.

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,958
And I've spoke at tons of SQL Saturdays. I speak in Baton Rouge every year.

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:40,958
I've spoke at Birmingham, Alabama, Mobile, Alabama. I've spoke at Atlanta before and so on.

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:46,958
I speak at some SharePoint Saturdays as well. I spoke last year at SharePoint Saturday in Nashville.

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:54,958
The Microsoft Virtual Academy. Now SAPIEN Technologies, the reason I have them under the free section is they

9
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:59,958
have some really good blog articles that June Blender is writing and also their forums.

10
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,958
They actually have some decent forums and it's not just related to their products.

11
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:09,958
They have some on just writing PowerShell code because as a SAPIEN Technologies MVP, I've been answering some

12
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:14,958
of those questions. PowerShell Magazine. I've written numerous articles there.

13
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,958
User groups. I run the Mississippi PowerShell user group as I mentioned earlier.

14
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:25,958
That's a virtual user group. If you don't have a local user group and we record our meetings as well on our YouTube channel.

15
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:30,958
You can, an alias for that user group website is mspowershell.com.

16
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:37,958
Twitter is another resource. GitHub, blogs. If you want to find a list of good blogs, go to my blog site

17
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,958
and see my blog role.

18
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:45,958
If the people that I have in my blog role are not writing good code or not consistently blogging, then they get

19
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:51,958
deleted off the list and somebody else gets added.

20
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:59,958
There's a PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide and this slide deck is also on GitHub under my presentations repository.

21
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:06,958
All these are links to these sites, but that's the reading material I referenced at the beginning if your code

22
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:11,958
is not passing script analyzer. Okay, there's a couple of paid product.

23
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:16,958
I was actually the technical author for this Pro PowerShell for Database Developers.

24
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:23,958
It's a good book. And then also Pluralsight. We've got one more slide.

25
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:28,958
So that's my contact info. There's the book I co-authored and also the one I wrote a chapter in.

26
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:33,958
I'm a big believer in personal branding, so you'll find me at mikefrobbins pretty much anywhere.

27
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:41,958
Sign up for services, even if I don't use them. If you want my email address, I have a challenge for you.

28
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:49,958
Go out to my blog site, see the about page, my email address, my real email address is encoded, so decode it

29
00:02:49,958 --> 00:59:59,999
and send me an email. And then there's the user group. Thank you guys for attending.
