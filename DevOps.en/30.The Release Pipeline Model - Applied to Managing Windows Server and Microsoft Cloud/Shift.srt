00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,5
This is a super personal topic because this is what's going to help make your lives better.

2
00:00:05,5 --> 00:00:07,7
There's a lot of learning to kind of get our heads around,

3
00:00:07,7 --> 00:00:11,11
a lot of different terminology, so I'm going to get out of the way and let's dive in because we've got lots to cover.

4
00:00:11,11 --> 00:00:12,899
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:17,899
So I'm going to start with this slide because this is how big of a mind-boggling change this is.

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,899
So I was talking about this subject with a friend and he reached up on his shelf and handed me a book.

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,899
I believe it's the Theory of Scientific Revolution. It's by Thomas Kuhn.

8
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:32,899
But then he spoiled it for me and he told me when you read this, all you need to get out of it is the following.

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,899
And so, I searched for that and read that page and I didn't read the rest of the book, but I'm sure it's good.

10
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:47,899
The point is in order for a scientific revolution to be an actual revolution, to have a paradigm shift,

11
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,899
you have to satisfy two things. There's a new set of problems. So you're thing came out and it solved those problems.

12
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,899
Great. You also have to solve all the existing problems.

13
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,899
So when a new thing comes out in the industry and we're looking at it and saying is this something that's

14
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,899
going to be huge impact, it's great, yep, all these new cloud adoption and deployment type stuff,

15
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:15,899
it really helps out with that, but if it doesn't help solve that, by the way, I'm going to have servers that

16
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:23,899
are not real, I've been supporting these things or that model for 10 years and I can't just do continuous

17
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,899
deployments and knock these things over once a day. I'm going to support them like pets even though we want

18
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:32,899
to support everything like cattle and that's going to happen for a while, it has to support both, right.

19
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:38,899
The paradigm shift has to make your life better for all of the scenarios in order for it to actually be a

20
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:45,899
revolution, otherwise, it's just more tools, right. So

21
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,899
when I go out and the only like universal truth I've learned in my life to this point is that there's usually

22
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,899
not an extreme, right. Usually, things sort of land somewhere more at a moderate place.

23
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,899
So everything starts looking like a spectrum. If I go meet with 10 customers, I'm going to find some that

24
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:06,899
are really on the cutting edge. I'm like oh the whole world must be doing this and then I'll go to the next

25
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,899
customer, it's like oh, no they haven't changed at all. So as we met with people, I really found two voices.

26
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:20,899
The first was, yeah, yeah, we've been doing DevOps, so thanks for showing up and having an interest in what

27
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:22,899
we're doing because that's neat.

28
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,899
What we've been trying to figure out is how do we bring Windows Server into what we're doing, so when we go

29
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:32,899
meet with those customers and help figure out what their model looks like and how Windows Server can be part of

30
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:36,899
that, and obviously, PowerShell takes a huge role for something like that.

31
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:41,899
On the other side of the spectrum, you meet with customers and you explain what you just learned from the

32
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:47,899
first customer, I don't know what just happened, there we go, and they say yeah, yeah, that sounds like

33
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:51,899
you're speaking a developer language and that's not really an IT pro thing.

34
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:59,899
So 80 or 90% of the people are in the middle and they're just trying to keep things from falling over, right.

35
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:05,899
So you can walk up and talk about hey there's this other way people are doing things now and it's really

36
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:10,899
interesting and I think it's better and they're like look, I will look at making my life better after I'm

37
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,899
done with all these things that make my life hard. So I love that animation.

38
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:20,899
There's like three or four different versions of it. So we wrote this paper and it occurred to me just a

39
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:26,899
second ago that I should prescribe a hashtag. If anybody wants to tweet about it, you're more than welcome to.

40
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:30,899
It's live as of this morning. That short code should work. It goes directly to the pdf,

41
00:03:30,899 --> 00:59:59,999
and if you use that hashtag on Twitter, then I can search for it and I can tell my boss that lots of people were interested.
