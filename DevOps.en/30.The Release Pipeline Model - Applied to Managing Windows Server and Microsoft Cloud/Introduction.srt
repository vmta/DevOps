1
00:00:11,5 --> 00:00:15,5
So we've been working on this since about December.

2
00:00:15,5 --> 00:00:16,5
Yeah.

3
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:22,5
We were talking on the phone and said here's all the---we like to just chat about these are the things we're

4
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:26,5
seeing going on with all the different customers we visit and some patterns that are working and patterns

5
00:00:26,5 --> 00:00:31,5
that are not working and I'm going to cover this a little bit, but

6
00:00:31,5 --> 00:00:38,5
we really kind of decided we should write a paper that explains all of this in terms that IT pros will

7
00:00:38,5 --> 00:00:43,5
understand because there's all this chatter about DevOps and the amount of into is just flowing so quickly

8
00:00:43,5 --> 00:00:50,5
now that no one has taken pause to actually reflect on if you're coming from a background that's Microsoft

9
00:00:50,5 --> 00:00:57,5
Core infrastructure, what does all this mean to you and lay it out in a language that makes sense and that's

10
00:00:57,5 --> 00:01:03,5
comprehensive as to why it should matter to your organization, so that's what we decided to tackle.

11
00:01:03,5 --> 00:01:10,5
So this is a presentation, but we're releasing a whitepaper today, which I'll show you, I'll give a link to you,

12
00:01:10,5 --> 00:01:13,5
that's about 50 pages long. So

13
00:01:13,5 --> 00:01:19,5
for 20 minutes now, you guys just go ahead and read that and then we'll listen to your comments, no.

14
00:01:19,5 --> 00:01:25,5
But no, hopefully, it's valuable to you. I suspect that this will end up being the first edition and that

15
00:01:25,5 --> 00:01:29,5
we'll come back and make changes and I'll put up my information in front here.

16
00:01:29,5 --> 00:01:33,5
So before you get too far, who the heck are you?

17
00:01:33,5 --> 00:01:38,5
Well let me pull up the next slide with a picture of my jeep. So I'm Michael Greene.

18
00:01:38,5 --> 00:01:44,5
I'm a principal program manager here in Enterprise Cloud Group. I'm actually in the CAT team and I'm the CAT

19
00:01:44,5 --> 00:01:49,5
PM for PowerShell and DevOps. CAT is Customer Architectures and Technologies.

20
00:01:49,5 --> 00:01:54,5
It has historically been our job to drive customer feedback. So we run the TAP program, that kind of stuff,

21
00:01:54,5 --> 00:02:01,5
go out and meet with customers. I'm kind of the hunter in many ways now, so if you think about as Microsoft

22
00:02:01,5 --> 00:02:05,5
has become very customer focused,

23
00:02:05,5 --> 00:02:11,5
the CAT team ends up, previously we were driving customer feedback, well now it's like an even more aggressive role.

24
00:02:11,5 --> 00:02:16,5
It's go meet with as many people as you can and every time you find something interesting that we need to

25
00:02:16,5 --> 00:02:22,5
know about, make sure that you're just funneling all of that back to the PM team and we're continuing to evolve,

26
00:02:22,5 --> 00:02:28,5
so we did an Azure CAT team and an Office CAT team and more and more you see CAT team sort of working on the

27
00:02:28,5 --> 00:02:36,5
very latest cutting edge of what has come out and going to customers who are doing it first and being that

28
00:02:36,5 --> 00:02:42,5
on-site, I'm here from engineering so that when you run into things that we didn't expect, there's a direct

29
00:02:42,5 --> 00:02:47,5
conduit for those first couple of deployments to help make adoption easier.

30
00:02:47,5 --> 00:02:50,5
So it's like I'm from Microsoft and I'm here to help.

31
00:02:50,5 --> 00:02:57,5
Yeah. I should get a van with a logo on the side.

32
00:02:57,5 --> 00:03:04,5
I just wanted to put up, oh so I've been with Microsoft for 12 years, out of that, I spent from 2010 to late

33
00:03:04,5 --> 00:03:12,5
in 2012 in operations in what was called BPOS, now called Office 365. So

34
00:03:12,5 --> 00:03:21,5
Don Jones taught me PowerShell in version 1 and in 2010, I spent 3 years in operations PowerShelling everything,

35
00:03:21,5 --> 00:03:26,5
so I've lived a lot of the experiences that have resulted in things like what we're talking about today,

36
00:03:26,5 --> 00:03:30,5
so I've got a lot of hands-on experience of PowerShell.

37
00:03:30,5 --> 00:03:34,5
If you want to contact me, you're better off sending me a letter than sending me an email this week,

38
00:03:34,5 --> 00:03:40,5
so if you want a response, but you can hit me up on Twitter. I don't mind doing a little dance where you

39
00:03:40,5 --> 00:03:45,5
have to follow each other back and forth before we can DM each other or you're welcome to just tweet at me

40
00:03:45,5 --> 00:03:52,5
and we'll get in touch with each other. And my GitHub repo is Mgreenegit and we'll be referencing probably

41
00:03:52,5 --> 00:03:56,5
some stuff there. But Twitter is a good way to get a hold of me.

42
00:03:56,5 --> 00:04:03,5
When I come to this event and I walk around, for me, it's like walking amongst celebrities because I'm not

43
00:04:03,5 --> 00:04:08,5
really like into Hollywood celebrities, but when I look at Twitter and Slack channels and blogs and stuff

44
00:04:08,5 --> 00:04:13,5
like that, it's all of you guys that I'm reading every day, so coming here and looking around at all the

45
00:04:13,5 --> 00:04:18,5
badges and seeing those names, it's like whoa, that was that guy that I see every day and I've talked to him

46
00:04:18,5 --> 00:04:24,5
every week for the past 20, but I've never met him in person, so it's really my pleasure to be here.

47
00:04:24,5 --> 00:04:31,5
Great, and I'm Steve Morawski. I'm a principle engineer at Chef on the community engineering team.

48
00:04:31,5 --> 00:04:39,5
I do a bit of DSC in PowerShell and stuff for a few years and Michael and I just kept bumping into each other

49
00:04:39,5 --> 00:04:47,5
a lot at community events and at customers and talking about these same challenges, and so he's like hey

50
00:04:47,5 --> 00:04:55,5
here's eight pages I just kind of scrawled out on my thoughts on this topic and let's go and do stuff, and so we

51
00:04:55,5 --> 00:05:03,5
started collaborating back and forth and I just kind of rode along on his coat tails to help get some

52
00:05:03,5 --> 00:05:12,5
feedback into the paper and all. And for me, this concept is one of the most critical things as you start to

53
00:05:12,5 --> 00:05:20,5
move towards more DevOps environment and workflow. If you do not seriously look at addressing some of the

54
00:05:20,5 --> 00:05:28,5
concerns that we're going to walk through here, you will not realize all of the benefits from working with

55
00:05:28,5 --> 00:05:35,5
things like Desired State Configuration or Chef, being able to, you will not approach some of the big wins

56
00:05:35,5 --> 00:05:41,5
that you see in reports like the state of DevOps and things like that where you see these faster times to

57
00:05:41,5 --> 00:59:59,999
recovery and reduced failure rates and things like that. And so, for me, this is a---
