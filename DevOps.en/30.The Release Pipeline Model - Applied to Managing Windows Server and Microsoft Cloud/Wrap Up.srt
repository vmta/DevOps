00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,032
Just to start wrapping up, these are the, since we're at PowerShell Summit, learn Pester, learn PSake,

2
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:14,032
learn PSDeploy, go take a look at OVF. As you get further down the line, there are so many DevOps tools,

3
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:21,032
so as we update this slide, we'll continue growing this list, and in the whitepaper, we actually call out a wide variety.

4
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:29,032
Yeah, and one thing, I have a session on essential skills for DevOps world or something to that effect later this afternoon.

5
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:32,032
Michael is going to come join as well, so one of the things

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:38,032
we're going to talk about is build pipelines and the importance of continuous delivery and testing and all that,

7
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:42,032
so we can definitely have more time to dive into some of these concepts if you still wanted to.

8
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:45,032
We will make this probably my last slide.

9
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:46,032
Yep.

10
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:51,032
This is a huge point, so I just want to land this before we leave.

11
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:59,032
Coming from an infrastructure background, it's in our nature to say I found a new thing, this is my thing now,

12
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:05,032
and I'm going to focus on that and there's a couple of things that make this type of platform work.

13
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,032
One is you've got to get buy-in, right, from others in your org.

14
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:13,032
You can't do this alone because it only works if everyone agrees that the tests have to pass before we move forward.

15
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:18,032
The other is, keep your options open. So in the paper, we talk about things like how do you use this together

16
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:23,032
with ConfigMan and what's it look like to use this together with Group Policy because you're not going to cut

17
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:32,032
this over overnight and it's your job as you are the people, right, you are the people in your organization

18
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:39,032
that they look to as the lead architect that says how do we do this smart guy, right, and the answer is it's

19
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:44,032
not going to be a okay, well I stopped using this tool and now I'm using this tool and now we're a lot better, right.

20
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:49,032
That's just a tool change. It's the process change that makes this so valuable.

21
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:56,032
So we don't want to look like this with your precious. And now I've got my build server and now I'm just

22
00:01:56,032 --> 00:02:00,032
linked to this stuff, it's all I care about now. Nope, you've still got all the tools you had before.

23
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:05,032
It's a process change and you can bring all of these things forward and that's how you be the hero for your

24
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:10,032
organization and help them get into this new world.

25
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:17,032
So yeah, we'll talk about this applying this same model to everything and making it visible and everybody

26
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:21,032
should be on success. So we'll continue onto this such thing then.

27
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:21,5
Thank you.

28
00:02:21,5 --> 00:59:59,999
Great.
