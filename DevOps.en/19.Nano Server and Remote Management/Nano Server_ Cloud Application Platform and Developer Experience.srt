1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,232
Okay, so snapping back to where we were here. The point here is to support applications that are born in the cloud.

2
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:12,232
We're not trying to bring the legacy Win32 apps to Nano Server as the first tenant.

3
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:21,232
It's to support a new generation of application and tool. A subset of the Win32 APIs exist, again, CoreCLR,

4
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:28,232
PaaS, .NET and we want to have this kind of available as an OS everywhere, so you can install Nano as a host

5
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:34,232
OS onto bare metal, you can install it as a guest OS on a VM, you can install it within Windows Server

6
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:41,232
containers, Hyper-VM containers, run it in Azure, you can run it nested, you can do whatever you want.

7
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:46,232
With other hypervisors we want it to kind of be a utility more than anything else.

8
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:54,232
And future additions, as far as completion go, DSC will be feature complete in the next release of Nano server,

9
00:00:54,232 --> 00:01:00,232
so all the functionality that those of you that has played with it seems to be missing or not fully cooked

10
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:06,232
kind of the similar way that we did with WMF previews, what was in previous TPs was experimental, what'll be in

11
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,232
the next TP should be more lock down

12
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:15,232
and every day, we're getting more and more resources that are working with Nano out-of-the-box.

13
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:23,232
So we run into one issue when I try to join the domain. Are we allowed to be calling the Nano Server first

14
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:30,232
and then try the domain join or will it be the same issue like when you need to join in like new create an image.

15
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:37,232
Yeah, the question is right now with Nano Server you have to join the domain before you bring it up and the

16
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:41,232
question is whether you will be able to online domain join. In a future release of Nano Server, you will be

17
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:50,232
able to do online domain joining. Will it be like on the final version of the 2016 or will it even (inaudible)?

18
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:56,232
I can't answer that question. It's going to be in an upcoming release.

19
00:01:56,232 --> 00:02:03,232
Okay, so dev experience. I heard some people in the front row talking about writing C# code and I love hearing that.

20
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:08,232
So let's talk a little bit about what the developer experience is like.

21
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:12,232
And before I do that, so I should really ask that who's worked with PowerShell Node?

22
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:18,232
How many people have written C# code in the last 12 to 24 months?

23
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:27,232
That half of the room. Okay. Was there a sign out front? Cool, so here's the point with being able to take

24
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:32,232
what developer knowledge you have and take it to Nano Server. We don't want to redefine the developer

25
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:38,232
experience around a lightweight product. We want to take the best developer experience and bring that part

26
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:41,232
forward to Nano Server. So with that,

27
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:48,232
apps need to remove references to what's there, sorry, what is not in Nano Server and 32-bit references,

28
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:54,232
and developers can use Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 in the Windows SDK to target Nano Server today.

29
00:02:54,232 --> 00:03:00,232
This functionality has been around since TP3, but it's significantly better in the past few months.

30
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:07,232
So first of all, the latest version of PowerShell WIN 10 or server 2016 TP, the latest WMF, if you're using

31
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:12,232
a VM, you make sure Hyper-V is installed, connect to that Nano Server machine,

32
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:19,232
In Visual Studio Update 1, you do a custom install, mark those 2 additional options, and then this link,

33
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:25,232
which I will have available a couple of links at the end that will get you towards all this stuff.

34
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:33,232
We'll get you the details, the files that you need to load into Visual Studio, the v6 file, and then you run that,

35
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:38,232
follow the instructions to install it, import the module, and you're good to go, and start creating a Nano project.

36
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:45,232
And I know people previously prior to the TP3 timeframe had started pulling DLLs off of their Nano Server VMs

37
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:50,232
and trying to fuddle with it, but this is really a first class dev experience now and we look to refine it

38
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:56,232
and get it to the point where it is just like developing for any other skew of Windows.

39
00:03:56,232 --> 00:04:07,232
Yeah. Does this just pertain to unmanaged code or does it also pertain to anything .NET?

40
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,232
So the question is whether it pertains to unmanaged or managed code as well.

41
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:17,232
It pertains to a subset of .NET because not everything is there, but the intent here is that as we go through

42
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:24,232
this dev experience stuff, you would be able to explore a lot easier on your dev box what is and isn't available,

43
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:29,232
as opposed to blindly targeting and finding the APIs in there.

44
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:39,232
Okay, so it's more of like an API check versus allowing you to target .NET Core firmly right?

45
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:47,232
As we work towards a more holistic dev experience, yeah, you'll be able to say specifically target .NET Core.

46
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:54,232
The intent now is to kind of help you in exploring what it is and isn't there, and in addition to that,

47
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:58,232
there's an API port tool that the .NET team runs and that's on GitHub.

48
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:04,232
You can pull it down and say check my whatever you're working with, whatever file it is and see whether or

49
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:12,232
not this has APIs that are not CoreCLR compliant, or .NET Core, or ASP.NET compliant.

50
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:20,232
So project templates, full IntelliSense experience, your little error squiggles, full remote debugging experience.

51
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:28,232
If you download that thing that was linked and run that PowerShell script and all the info is on the Nano Server blog.

52
00:05:28,232 --> 00:05:34,232
It's with the last blog post from 2015, if you're looking for it, and it kind of outlines the process.

53
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:40,232
And then also for this half of the room, there is like a Hello World example in C# that you can run,

54
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:49,232
execute on your Nano Server and I think it's like eight or nine steps should take you five minutes.

55
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:56,232
Any questions about dev experience before we move on? Great. So reverse forwarders.

56
00:05:56,232 --> 00:06:02,232
Show of hands, who knows what this? Okay. Ten people. Alright.

57
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:10,232
So as we know, a missing DLL will result in an app failing to run, even if everything else that you require is present.

58
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:16,232
We need it to provide a way to run existing payloads without having to recompile for Nano Server.

59
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:23,232
So this doesn't eliminate the need to refactor code. This is merely meant as a stepping stone and having a

60
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:30,232
fully Nano Server compliant product. And so, there's a bunch of stuff that runs with reverse forwarders today.

61
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:37,232
Here's a sample of some of them and some of those versions have incremented as we've gone on and we're letting

62
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:46,232
up more and more that the intent here is to try and have these applications and these tools work directly on Nano

63
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:54,232
without the need for reverse forwards, like I said, it's a stepping stone, but they are there.

64
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:57,232
And so here's the colorful part. So let's talk about some of improvements.

65
00:06:57,232 --> 00:07:03,232
I know some of you will have seen this, but let's talk about what Nano Server, what benefits there are graphically.

66
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:10,232
So servicing. These are servicing the full patch cycle from 2014. It has not been updated for 2015 yet,

67
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:15,232
but this is kind of what it looks like between Nano, Server Core, and Full Server.

68
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:21,232
Critical bulletins. You can see that the number there is significantly more for full.

69
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:28,232
And number of reboots. So the point here being that like I said at the start of this, that the intent is to

70
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:36,232
work down to a point where we take all the benefits and all the great functionality that we brought when we

71
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:42,232
went to Server Core with a little cost that people had to incur there to go to Nano Server because the

72
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:48,232
benefits far outweigh the cost as you can see just from a servicing perspective.

73
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:58,232
Security. Drivers, I mean it's every driver is one more that you wish you could run without on Nano Server

74
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:03,232
compared to Server Core, we reduce that footprint by about a quarter.

75
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:08,232
Services running. So this is always a great thing to do when you first spin up your Nano Server VM is take a

76
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:13,232
look at the list of services. It looks a lot better than Server Core.

77
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:18,232
And open ports. For those of you security conscience folks, I know that jumps out at you right away.

78
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:28,232
Going from about 27 to 12, I believe.

79
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:34,232
And deployment. So setup time. What I'm going to show you at the end of this is a great way to get off the

80
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:40,232
ground with Nano for those of you that haven't. Those of you that have spun up your own Nano image and

81
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:46,232
injected all that stuff and spent hours and written great blogs about how people can do it easier are going to

82
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:53,232
feel like I should have just waited. We now have a URL that'll get you a Nano Server VHD.

83
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:59,232
No more of this fuddling around with it, so with that setup time, under 50 seconds.

84
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:11,232
Disk footprint, half a gig! VHD size. So I mean on the way here, I realize I don't have a Nano VM with me.

85
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:16,232
My box is in my car for this afternoon's lightning demo, which I recommend you all come with all of our Nano

86
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:23,232
VMs on it. But this right here took me 45 seconds.

87
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:31,232
I had downloaded the VHD through into Hyper-V and it's what I'll use to show a demo here in a sec.

88
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:41,232
Sorry. (Audience question) Yeah, hang tight. So an installation option like Server Core here for 2016.

89
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:47,232
It's not the installation option. It is something that you pull off of media.

90
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:51,232
It's not listed in setup because there's additional steps that are required.

91
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:56,232
It wouldn't be really logical to step through the Windows setup process when what you really need is to configure

92
00:09:56,232 --> 00:10:07,232
an image that you can reuse. So as you can see on the Windows Server TP4 ISO, there's a NanoServer folder.

93
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,232
And for drivers, for the leanest image, you just bring in what you want.

94
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:16,232
So we provide a couple of conveniences that I'll again show you in a minute, but it's as simple as just

95
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:24,232
injecting your driver as you vote to configure image. And all of the drivers that you experience, that you expect

96
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:30,232
from Server Core are available through this Nano Server OEM Drivers package.

97
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:37,232
And to run as a VM, define that Guest package.

98
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:41,232
So what I was talking about is features being available as you want them.

99
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:48,232
You'll notice that there is a subdirectory of packages. As we move forward, this will slightly change.

100
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:55,232
It will become much more logical in that they will not be static packages available on media.

101
00:10:55,232 --> 00:11:01,232
I'll let you put two and two together. Right now, this is how you add packages.

102
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:07,232
Again, this experience will be greatly improved and for those of you that decide to take that VHD that I'm

103
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:14,232
going to show to you today between now and the time you start playing with that, in the next release coming out,

104
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:17,232
you may not have to fiddle with this too much because you might have everything you need, especially if you're

105
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:22,232
running in Hyper-V.

106
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:29,232
So let's talk about installation agents, tools, other software. So no MSI support in Nano right now.

107
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:35,232
Current builds require that you drop whatever you need on there or have a PowerShell script and there is new

108
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:38,232
installer technology coming. There's been some blog posts about it.

109
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:45,232
Again, upcoming release of Nano Server. So you'll be able to install, uninstall, inventory, do offline and

110
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:51,232
online installation support to kind of integrate it into your environment.

111
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:58,232
And then this is what I was talking about deploying. So up to now, you could go and do a bunch of work.

112
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:05,232
There is a tool now, the NanoServerImageGenerator, you can import that, and then you are able to just kick

113
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:12,232
off building the image, kind of just put the pieces together, run your Convert-WindowsImage and you're good

114
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:23,232
to go or there's a link, aka.ms/nanoeval will take you to a page that will describe the TP4 Nano eval process.

115
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:30,232
There's a ULA, you click the link, and it downloads a VHD, you put that VHD into Hyper-VM, and you're good to go.

116
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:36,232
I'm sure some of you could do it now and before we're done, you'd have Nano running.

117
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:38,232
So accept it,

118
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:50,232
deploys in a few. (Audience comment) Sorry. Yeah, or use your great cellular data connections.

119
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:57,232
But we have this available and if you guys want to sync with me, I actually have it available on my GUSB keys,

120
00:12:57,232 --> 00:59:59,999
so I can hook those up and you can just copy it off to speed up the process.
