1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,739
So RSMT is one of the management options that I mentioned. So how many people have taken a look at RSMT?

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:11,739
Show of hands. Alright. How many people know what RSMT is, have heard of it?

3
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:21,739
Okay, so many more people. Great. So RSMT is a web-based portal to manage and it kind of includes

4
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:26,739
replacements for all of those local-only tools that you've either had to already PN or set up a remote

5
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:33,739
session to, so task manager, event viewer, device manager, control panel, even PowerShell, disk management,

6
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,739
File Explorer, all that stuff is there, and the team is continuing to greenlight more and more functionality.

7
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:54,739
So with that, I have a little video put together here that I'll walk us through of RSMT.

8
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:01,739
Alright. So this video is publicly available and there's a link to it at the end, but I just kind of wanted

9
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,739
to walk you guys through this. So RSMT as you can see in the nicely piece of portal that we've grown

10
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:15,739
accustomed to on Azure takes the server properties and then what you'll see here is a blade that shows you

11
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:22,739
all the details about that server. So you have the typical resource plan and IP info, you have blades for,

12
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,739
or you have all the performance information listed, and all the tools.

13
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:35,739
So here we'll step through kind of one by one to show you guys what you can see by RSMT, so OS info,

14
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:41,739
computer id info, so computer name, whether it's part of a workgroup or domain, you can change those settings

15
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:46,739
there as well without having to remote into the box or use any sort of remoting.

16
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:55,739
You can work with users by adding users there, network information is there, adapter info.

17
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,739
And then so if you look at each of these individual performance, you're actually getting a lot more

18
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:02,739
functionality than anywhere else we've been able to provide this stuff remotely,

19
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:10,739
so CPU information, network load info, memory use utility, usage, sorry, and disk metrics.

20
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,739
Disk metrics are turned off by default for performance, but you can enable those and start getting disk

21
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:22,739
metrics pulled in and there you go, so that's pulling off of the VM there.

22
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,739
And then for the tools, these are some of the tools I mentioned.

23
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:31,739
You can look at processes, you can search for processes, create process dumps and processes via this web UI.

24
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:40,739
You can also run new processes, so if you hit that Run Process button, type in the process you want to run,

25
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,739
hit OK, and it'll show back up there. You can add some more detail that isn't there by default, by using the

26
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:53,739
call and selector similar to how you would in Task Manager. And similarly with services, you have the

27
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:01,739
ability to start/stop/pause services, you can search for services, a really cool way to edit the registry,

28
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,739
so no more having to remote in or start a remote registry session.

29
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,739
You can go through here, search for whatever you need to change, whatever you need to add, gives you a nice

30
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:16,739
UI to do that stuff in. Adding roles and features is coming. For now, this just displays what's currently

31
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:29,739
enabled in remote PowerShell. So from a browser on whatever device you choose, you can remote PowerShell

32
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:36,739
into whatever box, in this case, this VM that we've got setup here and everything that you would expect about

33
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:45,739
discovery will also work. And you can see that it's following that same abuse of blade concept,

34
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,739
like the team has worked really hard to make this UIP as discoverable as possible.

35
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:56,739
Device Manager functionality works great. You can see devices. This is really good for debugging

36
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,739
environments or somewhere where you're trying to troubleshoot what's going on with the system.

37
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,739
Same principles that apply to maintaining systems in the cloud, kind of apply in the hybrid environment now.

38
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:17,739
And lastly, event viewer, so you can navigate through the event logs, can manipulate the query.

39
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,739
You mentioned File Explorer. Will that be available soon? Yeah, yeah.

40
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,739
So for the time being, since we're all PowerShell folks, you can do that stuff from the PowerShell prompt,

41
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:29,739
but there's two or three more tiles that are going to show up in the very near future.

42
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:35,739
Is there anything that they can't do in PowerShell that the basic UI will allow you to, like when you enable

43
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:40,739
disk metrics, can I turn that on via PowerShell? No. That has to be done through the UI because what it's

44
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,739
actually doing is reaching out to the agent on that

45
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:51,739
server. Firewall port that this used. Is this the standard PowerShell warning in our end?

46
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:57,739
So it's actually using an agent that you installed that configures that stuff for you and then you have the

47
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,739
ability to customize however you want it to connect, what port you want it to connect.

48
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:04,739
Yeah, yeah. You can definitely lock it down. (Audience question)

49
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:08,739
Sorry. Can you repeat questions? Can I repeat questions? Sure, sure, absolutely.

50
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,739
Are you going to interact with that agent that installed via PowerShell?

51
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:14,739
The question is are you able to interact with the agent via PowerShell.

52
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:17,739
So no. There isn't much interactivity for the agent. It's a base.

53
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:22,739
Is that planned? Yes, it is planned. Yeah. And when I say something is planned, I will caveat that it's

54
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,739
saying it's coming in an upcoming release of Nano Server, alright.

55
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:32,739
Is there an API exposed for this? Not currently, not currently.

56
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:37,739
Yep. Will this be available for Core as well or just Nano? Will this be available for Server Core?

57
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:42,739
It will be available for all flavors of Windows Server. Yep. The solution that you're trying in Azure,

58
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:50,739
so is this interface available for on-prem Nano or just Azureâ€¦? So you can actually connect it to whatever

59
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,739
you want in your hybrid environment locally, but it does run in Azure.

60
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:59,739
So you'd go into Azure, connect your computer to it, and then you can manipulate, or you could connect to it

61
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:04,739
even if it's a local machine. If it's off the internet right now, there is no way, but there is plans to try

62
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:10,739
and get this gateway service to run locally. How can you connect with a small IPM?

63
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:15,739
With IP address you can just define the same way we define that computer with the network it was in, you can just

64
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:20,739
define over the internet. (Audience question) Sorry? What ports are you using?

65
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:25,739
So I believe the RSMT team uses the default WINRM ports in addition to a couple of other.

66
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:30,739
I can get those details for you after. So is this available only if you have Azure?

67
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:34,739
It is only available with an Azure, yeah, with an Azure account right now.

68
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:39,739
Yep. Will the IOP web base in the interface follow this at some point?

69
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:47,739
Sorry, can you repeat the question? Will the IOT, the I-O-T management interface, will that follow along with this?

70
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:53,739
Or the two submerge? Yeah, the question is whether the IOT management interface will look like this.

71
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:58,739
I can't answer that question because I'm not part of the IOT team, but I can definitely get those details

72
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:02,739
for you if you want to sync up with me after this session. Okay.

73
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:13,739
Yes. Are there plans to manage any down rev operating systems? I can definitely reach out to the RSMT team

74
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:16,739
for you and get you the latest details on that if you want to sync up with me after.

75
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:23,739
Sure. Okay. Any other questions about RSMT? Yeah. I don't know if it's along the same lines, but do you

76
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:30,739
see does this support the server manager going to replace with short one larger?

77
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:39,739
The question is does this replace server manager? This is currently in addition to the management portfolio, right.

78
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:45,739
To answer your question, server manager is still there in the most recent server installs.

79
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:55,739
Yeah. Any other questions? Yeah. Are the clients just like RBAC just for the different toolsets?

80
00:07:55,739 --> 00:08:02,739
Sorry, one more time? Is there an RBAC, like the role-based access control for the different rules that will be available?

81
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:07,739
You're talking about as to what you see here, like can you gray out certain functionality for a certain user?

82
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:18,739
Correct. There are plans to put segregated controls over certain functionality into the RSMT portal,

83
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,739
but I can't speak to when those will be in. Again, if you want to sync with me after, I can definitely give

84
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:29,739
you more details. Yes. So access control, does it have, can I, for example, have my own servers and my own

85
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:37,739
group, maybe someone outside of my organization access to manage a single server or do you do details on a single server?

86
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:43,739
Yeah. It would depend on. Sorry, the question is if you can have some sort of access where within a group

87
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:48,739
of servers you would have, give someone delegated access to one specific node, and yes, you could do that.

88
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:56,739
It'd be dependent on your infrastructure and how you're visible to the internet, but there's actually one or two

89
00:08:56,739 --> 00:09:01,739
examples of that being done and if you want to sync with me after, I can share those with you as well.

90
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:08,739
Yeah. Any other questions about RSMT or anything we've covered so far?

91
00:09:08,739 --> 00:59:59,999
Okay. Let's keep going.
