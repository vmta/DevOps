Little bit of commentary on how we've been doing with PowerShell Gallery, I said you all have been working

2
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:25,053
with it and adopting it fairly well. As of, I guess it was Mid-February, we passed 1 million downloads.

3
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:28,053
We're at 1.4 million now.

4
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:36,053
It's growing rapidly. The statistics page shows this hockey stick of growth and if you are familiar with it,

5
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:44,053
that actually says we're very stable. So as of about Mid-February, we realized we are stable enough plus we

6
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:52,053
had implemented the support for antivirus scanning and also we've built in script analyzer scanning to make

7
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:59,053
sure that the code that's coming into the gallery meets a basic bar, so people can trust it.

8
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:04,053
A lot of what we focus on is ensuring that the features that we're adding are about trust.

9
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:13,053
The people who publish, we have about 700 people who've registered to publish, okay?

10
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:21,053
We have about 700,000 people who are downloading. You guys can do the math.

11
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:30,053
We will focus our energies on ensuring that the people who are requiring content that experience is optimized

12
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:36,053
and so there will be times occasionally when you're going to come in say well that seems like you're putting

13
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:41,053
a little extra burden on the publisher that's because we want the things that are out on the gallery to be

14
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:49,053
something that somebody can look at and make a trust decision. Yes, I trust it, no, I don't.

15
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:55,053
Some of the lightening demos that you saw yesterday including the viewing scripts, including some of the

16
00:01:55,053 --> 00:02:03,053
other things that we show here, those are being put into place so that people know I can trust this content.

17
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:12,053
We're also adding in integration with Azure automation and some improved filtering and I'll show you that UI

18
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:15,053
in just a little bit.

19
00:02:15,053 --> 00:59:59,999
So real quick, let's do some demo because otherwise you guys will kill me.
