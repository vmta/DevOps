00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,7
So take a look at this thing and I'm going to recommend that you go through this code.

2
00:00:07,7 --> 00:00:10,5
It's actually pretty simple, straightforward, and easy to follow.

3
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:16,16
If I can, you can. Trust me. Okay.

4
00:00:16,16 --> 00:00:25,25
So, last element, how these concepts relate to a CI/CD pipeline. And I've been running through this stuff pretty fast.

5
00:00:25,25 --> 00:00:31,31
This whole week is primarily about how does this fit within DevOps.

6
00:00:31,31 --> 00:00:37,37
Package management is here so that what you can do is you can say I know where to get the things that belong

7
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:39,39
on my box.

8
00:00:39,39 --> 00:00:46,46
You can set up your internal repository, you can register as long as you understand what the package source

9
00:00:46,46 --> 00:00:52,5
type is and you're not modifying it, you can take the existing package type, and say the source for all packages

10
00:00:52,5 --> 00:00:57,57
of this type are here. Everything that I've validated is here.

11
00:00:57,57 --> 00:01:04,64
All of my servers are only going to go here to fetch something. Then your release pipeline can make sure that

12
00:01:04,64 --> 00:01:14,74
everything gets published there. Your DSC resources when they run will only get things from there.

13
00:01:14,74 --> 00:01:21,5
Alright. So this is all about ensuring that you have the control to drive the system the way that you want to.

14
00:01:21,5 --> 00:01:25,85
So now, what we're really going to do is we're going to dance here.

15
00:01:25,85 --> 00:01:31,91
Raghu and I are going to swap out machines real quick. And I'm going to let Raghu show you how he put it all

16
00:01:31,91 --> 00:59:59,999
together for the internal repository of private PowerShell Gallery repositories.
