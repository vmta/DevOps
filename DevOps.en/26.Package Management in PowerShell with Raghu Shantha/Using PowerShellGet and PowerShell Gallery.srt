1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,2
So basic PowerShellGet functions, and boy that's just in a bad spot.

2
00:00:06,2 --> 00:00:10,2
Sorry, folks, I've got to figure out how to use the mouse with this thing sitting here.

3
00:00:10,2 --> 00:00:17,2
So Get-Command, this is all the stuff that's available in PowerShellGet and I've already done this.

4
00:00:17,2 --> 00:00:26,2
Now one of the things that you will see here is you can do some filtering in PowerShellGet in order to find

5
00:00:26,2 --> 00:00:30,2
the things that you're looking for and a lot of people don't know how to go about this, so

6
00:00:30,2 --> 00:00:34,2
I thought I would spend just a minute and show you how to do that.

7
00:00:34,2 --> 00:00:42,2
Right now, we have a number of things that are out in the gallery that talk about the ISE, right.

8
00:00:42,2 --> 00:00:56,2
So which one is actually the one that came from Microsoft? Well, looks like that one is, PowerShell ISE preview.

9
00:00:56,2 --> 00:01:01,2
So if you go ahead and you have to do the filtering the way that you guys are familiar with, it's Where-Object

10
00:01:01,2 --> 00:01:06,2
and author, and I'll publish all this stuff. You're going to see a lot more of our documentation increasing

11
00:01:06,2 --> 00:01:14,2
here, but this is one of the most commonly asked questions, how do I find things in the gallery based on the author?

12
00:01:14,2 --> 00:01:19,2
Okay. How do I find something in the gallery where the author is Amazon?

13
00:01:19,2 --> 00:01:27,2
So the point being trust, you can go ahead and you can locate the things that you care about in the gallery

14
00:01:27,2 --> 00:01:31,2
based on who it is and whether or not you can trust them.

15
00:01:31,2 --> 00:01:38,2
One of the other elements of trust is, okay, what are the things that this depends on?

16
00:01:38,2 --> 00:01:45,2
I already told you that I can take a dependency on your module. Well one of the things that this HistoryPX

17
00:01:45,2 --> 00:01:50,2
module, which by the way, seems like a pretty good module. I skimmed through the code the other day.

18
00:01:50,2 --> 00:01:52,2
Did anybody in here write that?

19
00:01:52,2 --> 00:01:53,2
It's Kirk right?

20
00:01:53,2 --> 00:01:55,2
It's Kirk's.

21
00:01:55,2 --> 00:02:02,2
I didn't see Kirk so alright. So he's got a set of dependencies that are available on that module, right,

22
00:02:02,2 --> 00:02:08,2
and what we talk about is you need to know what it is that you are installing on your system.

23
00:02:08,2 --> 00:02:15,2
I can do a save module and all of those dependencies will get installed onto my box and you can read through

24
00:02:15,2 --> 00:02:22,2
that here as the verbose commands go by, you see SnippetPX right there is one of the elements that was a

25
00:02:22,2 --> 00:02:29,2
dependency, and we will install those dependencies, just like I said I can take a definite dependency on

26
00:02:29,2 --> 00:02:34,2
something somebody else wrote and it'll get installed using PowerShellGet.

27
00:02:34,2 --> 00:02:43,2
So again, these are all about what can I trust and that's the main focus that we have for the gallery, alright.

28
00:02:43,2 --> 00:02:48,2
So now let's take a look at what's actually in the gallery.

29
00:02:48,2 --> 00:02:53,2
One of the things that you saw a little bit of UI about is we've had a number of questions in the last little

30
00:02:53,2 --> 00:03:01,2
bit about where, how do I find all of the modules that don't have DSC in them.

31
00:03:01,2 --> 00:03:04,2
Did you all see the lightening demos yesterday?

32
00:03:04,2 --> 00:03:05,2
(Audience comment)

33
00:03:05,2 --> 00:03:12,2
Okay, well this is one of my favorite pieces of UI because it responds to, I've got 181 items in this test

34
00:03:12,2 --> 00:03:17,2
gallery, and know I'm going to try hard not to show you that URL because that's our test gallery.

35
00:03:17,2 --> 00:03:24,2
Yes, it's live. Don't use it if you discover it. It's there and we will blow up your stuff if you put it there.

36
00:03:24,2 --> 00:03:29,2
But if I want to see just the cmdlets and just the functions, the things that contain just the cmdlets and

37
00:03:29,2 --> 00:03:35,2
functions, this new filtering UI, which will be out in the next few weeks is something that you can go ahead

38
00:03:35,2 --> 00:03:42,2
and take advantage of. And again, it's trying to make sure that you can find what you're after, alright.

39
00:03:42,2 --> 00:03:49,2
The only piece of searching that you can do, or the only way you can do searching for owner, and owner is the

40
00:03:49,2 --> 00:03:58,2
actual person who published a package, is by using this UI today, okay.

41
00:03:58,2 --> 00:04:07,2
you can't find it in the search functions in and you'll find module or find DSC resource, so this is a quick tip.

42
00:04:07,2 --> 00:04:11,2
It's the only one of the demos that I'm going to show here now in the interest of time.

43
00:04:11,2 --> 00:04:18,258
But if you want to find out everything from PowerShell team, or from Kirk, or from anybody else, the best way

44
00:04:18,258 --> 00:59:59,999
to do that is in the gallery, you search for owner and then the owner name, alright.
