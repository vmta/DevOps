1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,5
And yes, I'm running through this kind of quick and my apologies.

2
00:00:05,5 --> 00:00:11,11
Package management improvements. Main things that we've added. Support for containers.

3
00:00:11,11 --> 00:00:20,5
Nano Server optional packages are coming in TP5. Windows Server packages, again, coming in TP5.

4
00:00:20,5 --> 00:00:27,27
The ability to deploy something onto the Nano box when TP5 ships in the next couple of months, you should be

5
00:00:27,27 --> 00:00:32,5
able to try this out. We are very much looking forward to your feedback on how well that works.

6
00:00:32,5 --> 00:00:39,39
Multiple package provider versions side-by-side. This is something that will start to count more as you write

7
00:00:39,39 --> 00:00:51,51
your own package providers. A package provider is I'm going to take a blob of goo that is going to be put

8
00:00:51,51 --> 00:01:00,60
onto my box, unpacked somehow, and run through some process at the end of which it's installed, right.

9
00:01:00,60 --> 00:01:06,66
Blob of goo gets put on my box package, blob of goo. Alright, fine.

10
00:01:06,66 --> 00:01:15,75
I can have multiple versions of a package provider that I use for different things and I do this with my own

11
00:01:15,75 --> 00:01:22,82
PowerShellGet package provider because I have the internal gallery and I have the external gallery and I have

12
00:01:22,82 --> 00:01:27,87
both of them registered and both of them tested locally so that I can work back and forth between them,

13
00:01:27,87 --> 00:01:31,91
between the dev environment and the production environment.

14
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:33,93
Event Log Support.

15
00:01:33,93 --> 00:01:36,96
Well if you're going to do something on a machine, it would be nice to know that you can

16
00:01:36,96 --> 00:01:42,102
actually see what happened and we've also again we've gotten rid of this nasty -version thing.

17
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:47,107
We've created the ability to install the NuGet provider locally

18
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:52,112
and we've added credential support. So let's

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:02:03,123
here's the set of package providers that I've got on my local box and you can see that I've got MSI, MSU,

20
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:08,128
NuGet, a bunch of things that are present there and different package sources and this is where you start to

21
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:14,134
see I've got two package sources, don't write that URL, but the point is,

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,5
those package sources are there and this is one of the tools you can take advantage of.

23
00:02:18,5 --> 00:02:25,145
A lot of people are asking when I create my internal gallery, how do I control and make sure that the systems

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:35,155
only use that internal gallery. Well the way that I do that is I register the package source for

25
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:44,5
PowerShellGet to be the internal repository and I remove the default PowerShellGet registration for PowerShell Gallery.

26
00:02:44,5 --> 00:02:50,170
Now when I use PowerShellGet, all those cmdlets will only go to your internal gallery.

27
00:02:50,170 --> 00:03:01,181
So package source, Set-PackageSource, and Get-PackageSource, this allows you to manage where you're getting things from.

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:07,5
One of the other things that you need to be aware of is we're not the only people who are publishing package management providers.

29
00:03:07,5 --> 00:03:11,191
It turns out that there's a few other people who are putting things on the gallery as well.

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:19,199
You'll notice that the GistProvider is out there, and we've got an example that I'll show you here in just a minute,

31
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,205
that'll walk you through how to create your package management providers.

32
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:31,211
JQuery is one of the NuGet packages that's available.

33
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,5
The problem with jQuery is that it's available on more than one location.

34
00:03:34,5 --> 00:03:39,219
Okay, so there's something I want to show you here and I'm going to back this up just a little bit.

35
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:47,227
If I do a Find-Package jQuery, the first thing that happens is I check all of the package locations that are

36
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:56,236
available that are registered on my box, okay. If I want that to run a little bit faster, I either use

37
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:05,5
the source or the provider name in order to find the one that I'm after.

38
00:04:05,5 --> 00:04:10,250
Then, I can go ahead and save it, install it, and manipulate it.

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:21,261
So one of the other elements that I can do is I can take advantage of the fact that I can handle all of the

40
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,263
installed versions of a module,

41
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:30,270
so I installed two versions of Desired State Configuration from the gallery, alright.

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,274
I want to be able to say

43
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:43,283
make sure that I only have the right version of my module present-- Oh that's right, version's gone.

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:49,289
Gee.

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,295
We got rid of version.

46
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,300
Alright, you guys are all going to make the same mistake I just did.

47
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,307
You're going to try to use version. The reason we got rid of version is because I've got two versions of X

48
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:13,313
Desired State Configuration there. Right. I don't want to have version, treat it like minimum version,

49
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:18,318
and delete everything off my box. Use required version when you want to use that parameter.

50
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
Okay.

51
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:27,327
Now one other thing that people have been asking us for is the ability, can you see that font there or do I

52
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
need to zoom it in.

53
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
It needs to be a bit bigger.

54
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,5
Okay. Visible?

55
00:05:32,5 --> 00:05:33,333
Yeah.

56
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
Alright.

57
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:41,341
So get the PackageProviders available on this box.

58
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,345
Well it turns out this box isn't connected to the internet.

59
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:50,350
It's not connected to anything. It' a little VM that's local. One of the things that folks have asked us

60
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:58,358
for is the ability to say how do I deal with packages and with a NuGet installation.

61
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:03,5
Every time you use PowerShellGet, the first thing that happens is I get this you need to install NuGet warning.

62
00:06:03,5 --> 00:06:05,365
You guys seen this?

63
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
Yes.

64
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:11,371
Yes, you have. Okay. So

65
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:22,382
I have a local copy of this thing available right here. As of the latest version of the package management,

66
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:30,5
I can do Install-PackageProvider and it will go ahead and update it and put it on the local machine.

67
00:06:30,5 --> 00:06:36,396
You'll be able to get rid of those warnings forever. So in your sequences for your installations,

68
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:45,405
you're going to be able to get the NuGet provider that you want, put it on a local share, treat that as a local

69
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:50,410
source, install it, you get rid of that nasty message so that now

70
00:06:50,410 --> 00:07:01,421
I have 1, no more funny warning messages such as you saw before, right, all those funny warning messages are gone,

71
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:06,426
and 2, I have the package, the NuGet package available.

72
00:07:06,426 --> 00:59:59,999
Okay.
