1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,179
Okay, I'll take this slide. So one thing I wanted to talk a little bit about is why we went down this path

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:14,179
of bringing kind of PowerShell into the cloud and what were the reasons we thought about as we went down this path.

3
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:20,179
And I think the first one was-- we've seen a lot of customers, probably a lot of you are starting to look at

4
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:26,179
adopting cloud technologies and it might be that most of your stuff is on-premises today, but you're also

5
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,179
trying to say how do I take advantage as I move some of my services and applications to the cloud,

6
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,179
how can I also think about moving my management?

7
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:39,179
And so there's kind of core capabilities that the cloud gives you and one of those is you need to be able to

8
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,179
integrate into all these different clouds now because you're not going to get rid of all your on-premises

9
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,179
stuff as you start to bring things into Azure or into AWS or even into your own service provider.

10
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:54,179
So you want to be able to like talk to all those systems and still Integrate them today just like you might do on-premises.

11
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,179
The other thing that's been going around for a long time in the automation space is how do you deliver self-service?

12
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:04,179
Most of us are involved in writing PowerShell so that we can kind of complete some process, either a small process

13
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:10,179
on our own server or large processes that go across an entire organization and we think about that and one

14
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:14,179
of the main goals we have around that is so that we can offer out that automation to our end users so that

15
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:20,179
they can actually accomplish their tasks when they need it. And so as you think about the cloud, it just drives

16
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:24,179
the self-service capabilities. That's really what cloud is about is I want on-demand virtual machines,

17
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:31,179
I want on-demand storage, SQL, it's really about that self-service capabilities and how do we deliver self-service

18
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:34,179
around PowerShell as well as we go forward.

19
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,179
And then the last thing that I think if you look at the conference and where everyone is focused right now is

20
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:44,179
a lot on DevOps. How do we really enable the kind of continuous deployment of our services and applications,

21
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:49,179
working with the development teams, with the operations team, and allow that to go seamlessly back and forth

22
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,179
as continuous development happens.

23
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:56,179
A lot of people call this like infrastructure as code or some other name around it, but the idea is how do we

24
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:01,179
have the common tooling so that our development teams and our operations teams can actually talk the same

25
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:09,179
language, use the same tools, and gain the benefits of kind of that end-to-end development and management.

26
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,179
And then the other trend I talk a little bit about is as people start to think about okay I want to take

27
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:17,179
advantage of the cloud because I gain all the benefits of scale out there, I don't have to worry about the

28
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,179
infrastructure, how does management also play into that? You know, why

29
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:25,179
would you want to move your management to cloud and it's really the same reasons you might want to move

30
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:29,179
anything to the cloud is you don't really want to have to manage the infrastructure anymore.

31
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:33,179
You want to take advantage of the capabilities that cloud gives you and focus more on those scripts you're

32
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:38,179
writing and the process you're trying to do and not managing infrastructures.

33
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:43,179
The other big trend we've seen and I don't know if you guys are seeing it as well is that the world is

34
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:48,179
getting more and more heterogeneous and we think about heterogeneous it's mostly around, we live in a lot of

35
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:49,179
a Windows space,

36
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:53,179
but most of the customers we talk with and probably a lot of you have other systems in your environments.

37
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:58,179
You probably have Linux in your environments, but for sure you have other management solutions.

38
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,179
You're probably not running all of the management stack. And so, how do you talk to all of those systems

39
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:06,179
as they start to grow and grow, and as you move to the cloud, they just grow more and more.

40
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:10,179
And so we really want to think about how do we go about solving that communication, that integration across

41
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:15,179
Windows, Linux, as well as all the different systems you have to talk to complete that process.

42
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:22,179
And then the last one is I think everyone here is committed that kind of automation in PowerShell is the way

43
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:27,179
to actually automate your end-to-end process, but it also starts to put a lot more pressure on the systems

44
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:30,179
because now we're seeing automation at scale.

45
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:35,179
Whereas before we might do some automation to complete some tasks, we now see it as a pillar for most organizations

46
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:40,179
as they start to develop more and more integrated management solutions across the environment, and so we

47
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:45,179
wanted to build something that says okay we can actually solve that problem and give you automation at scale,

48
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:49,179
so it can go from your small needs all the way up to the largest needs you might ever need because we're able

49
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:55,179
to bring it from the cloud. So that's kind of a lot of the reasons why actually started thinking about okay

50
00:03:55,179 --> 00:04:00,179
all the PowerShell stuff that works today, how can we actually bring that to the cloud, solve a lot of the problems

51
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:05,179
that you're seeing today, but also set you up for success in the future as you start to think about moving

52
00:04:05,179 --> 00:59:59,999
more and more assets towards the cloud.
