1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,148
Ed, do you want to talk about Operations Management Suite?

2
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:15,148
Absolutely. So this is showing Microsoft's IT management solution and if you look down here at the bottom,

3
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:23,148
we got System Center, and so system center has been around, it's very mature technology, and primarily it's

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:28,148
been used and focused for managing the on-premises servers, all those servers that are over their systems there

5
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:33,148
and talks to it and it helps to manage. And then a few years ago, Microsoft started getting into the cloud,

6
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:41,148
and so we've got Azure up there, and initially, the idea was hey we need to be able to provide the same kind of

7
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:48,148
management capabilities for the cloud that we've been able to have for our on-premises servers.

8
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:55,148
As we try to shift more of the load to the cloud, the need to manage it grows proportionally as well.

9
00:00:55,148 --> 00:01:01,148
And so, that's kind of where Operations Management Suite, the idea for it came from is that we need to be

10
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:07,148
able to manage this up there on the top, but we're not in a total cloud world.

11
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:15,148
We're not a total on-prem world. It's a hybrid world, and so the need really is there for hybrid management.

12
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:23,148
We need to be able to manage both. And by the way, in case you don't know, Azure isn't the only cloud service.

13
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:28,148
There's also this little thing that's called AWS or something that some people use.

14
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:37,148
And so, we need to be able to manage that too. And not only that, as a lot of times, people have their stuff

15
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:45,148
in both places. They've got Azure, they've got AWS. So there are four pillars for Microsoft Operations

16
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:49,148
Management Suite and there's a suite, so you can think of these four things.

17
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:54,148
As we were putting the product together, we drew from different resources and we brought stuff together.

18
00:01:54,148 --> 00:02:05,148
So a lot of people who have heard about OMS, they think it's all log analytics, analytics, monitoring,

19
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:13,148
and stuff like that, and that is a piece, but or people sometimes think yeah well it's automation and there

20
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:21,148
is a configuration and automation piece as well. On Monday, we talked about using the OMS automation in DCS

21
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:27,148
to solve a number of very real problems that we have with Desired State Configuration.

22
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:32,148
One of the simple ones to highlight out of that is setting up a pull server.

23
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:40,148
Setting up a pull server is kind of a pain. Setting up a pull server correctly is almost a shot in the dark.

24
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:46,148
We give that to you for free. As soon as you start doing OMS and automation, you've got that.

25
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:51,148
There's a backup in disaster recovery component. There is also a security and compliance component.

26
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:57,148
Some of the stuff that we have, we provide deep insights into your environment that allow you to pull this

27
00:02:57,148 --> 00:03:02,148
information out and expose stuff that you might not have even known was there.

28
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:11,148
And so, all of this, so OMS sits right there in the middle where we're doing the cloud, we're also doing the

29
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:20,148
on-prem, and because of that, as we're initially looking at a lot of our customers or looking at stuff,

30
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:26,148
we've got system center and OMS and they actually wind up being better together, but

31
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:34,148
OMS is not a cloud-only solution. We can do cloud, we can also do the on-prem, we can do Linux, yeah we can

32
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:39,148
do the other things, it's not necessarily a lay on top of system center.

33
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:44,148
You can have OMS by itself or you can have system center with OMS on top.

34
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:51,148
So it is pretty much the kind of management that you need for your environment that allows you to take care

35
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,148
of these capabilities.

36
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:54,148
Great.

37
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:57,148
Yeah, so I think the area we're going to focus on today obviously is a configuration automation.

38
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:03,148
It's most tied with all the PowerShell capabilities around all your scripts belong to your DSC.

39
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:08,148
But the last slide before we kind of give you an overview of what's going on is I think everybody starts to

40
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:13,148
realize when they look at the kind of lifecycle of the infrastructure and the application that there's a

41
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:18,148
bunch of capabilities required when you're actually managing not just infrastructure in the application and

42
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:23,148
it goes all the way up from how do you do the bills to how do you configure that and all the way through the

43
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:28,148
monitoring backup and recovery, how do you make sure it's secure, the governance, all of that is going to be

44
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:32,148
required as you start to think about especially in an enterprise world, what does it mean to manage the

45
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,148
infrastructure and the application.

46
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:38,148
And it's been a real challenge. I think we've had a lot of good tooling in System Center to actually help

47
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:42,148
with that with PowerShell and all the other management tools, but as you start to expand that to the cloud,

48
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:46,148
how do you still have the same processes as your stuff moves to the cloud?

49
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:51,148
And I think at the core of this, a lot of core services will offer their own kind of built-in automation.

50
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:55,148
Like when you do backup, it backs it up for you, and you can say that's automation because it backs it up for me.

51
00:04:55,148 --> 00:05:00,148
But a lot of times, you really need to connect systems together to really provide a solution and that's where

52
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:06,148
the configuration and automation servers can kind of he uses a core throughout your entire lifecycle,

53
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:10,148
not just the infrastructure and the application to make sure that the end-to-end works and at the core of

54
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:15,148
that is the PowerShell because of its ability to kind of connect into everything and deliver that service.

55
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:20,148
And so you'll see, as you start thinking about the whole lifecycle how automation configuration is actually

56
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:24,148
central to all of that. Obviously, when you do the configuration side and other things we have like built-in

57
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:29,148
capabilities itself like DSC that is required for that, when we think about the whole lifecycle,

58
00:05:29,148 --> 00:59:59,999
I would also say at the root of it all, it is configuration and automation.
