00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,809
So here's kind of the last slide. It's really about just what were the session objectives.

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:10,809
Hopefully, you learned about what we're doing, kind of where we're heading, how you can bring a lot of your PowerShell forward.

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,809
But I did want to mention as well that we have some customer days going on.

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,809
Ed maybe can talk about those.

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:25,809
So we've got customer days where people can come in. We actually have two of them scheduled and if you're

6
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:32,809
within the US, yeah just send me or Eamon an email and we'll see if we can get you into it.

7
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:37,809
It's for US only, but if you're internationally and you're willing to pay for your travel, then we'll put

8
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:41,809
you up for hearing that as well. The last thing is the

9
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:49,809
OMS blog, so blogs.technet msoms and that's where a lot of this stuff is and where a lot of it's going to be going forward.

10
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:56,809
And so, thank you. And with that, I've got some stickers, if you guys want to slide by, grab these as we

11
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,809
clear out the room for the next people.

12
00:00:58,809 --> 00:59:59,999
Alright, thanks guys.
