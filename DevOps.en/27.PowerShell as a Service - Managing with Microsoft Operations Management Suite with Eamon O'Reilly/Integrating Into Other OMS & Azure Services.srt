00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,388
Cool. I know we're running out of time, so I'm going to jump just into a last couple of slides.

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:16,388
One of the things that obviously there's real power in the service itself and that's where you can do all of

3
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:20,388
your automation, all your PowerShell, all your configurations inside of service, but you'll start to see

4
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:25,388
we've actually integrated it into a lot of the other OMS services as well.

5
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:29,388
And so as you're starting to do that monitoring and all that logging, it means you can actually now trigger

6
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:35,388
your automation so that if this action happens, which you're monitoring, maybe you want to escalate it to a

7
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:40,388
service disk or maybe you want to restart the VM. We're all depending on that process, you can now tie the

8
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:46,388
insides with the action together inside the services. Similarly, with site recovery, you can do pre-automation

9
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:52,388
scripts to run, some post automation scripts to make sure that failover actually happens and that's first

10
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:54,388
class integrated into the service.

11
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:59,388
And then there's a bunch of integration into Azure as well. So if you create Azure alert today, you can actually

12
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:03,388
say when this alert fires, I want to call a webhook. We didn't go into the webhooks, but we have webhooks

13
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:07,388
available on our service as well. That basically allows you to call them.

14
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:12,388
But then if you do anything on Azure VMs, we have rich integration where it says run this runbook.

15
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:15,388
It's not just a webhook, so we've kind of first classed that experience as well.

16
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:20,388
Obviously I mentioned earlier, it is because we're a service, it really makes it easy for you to extend it as well,

17
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:25,388
so you can write your own modules, they're going to work in the service, you can call our SDK,

18
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:30,388
you can leverage Azure resource manager, all of those capabilities are built into the service and allows you

19
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:36,388
to build on top of that and extend. So if you haven't tried it out, definitely do try out our SDK.

20
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:42,388
For the ISE add-on, I gave a link to GitHub here, so you can actually see where the source code lives if you

21
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:46,388
want to use it. I'll see if I can open that up.

22
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:48,388
But while I do,

23
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:56,388
let me just jump in real quick and show you what the ISE looks like because I think it's useful to see what it does.

24
00:01:56,388 --> 00:02:03,388
So you can see here I've actually logged in to the service, I can pick my subscription if you had multiple ones

25
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:07,388
and this, if you remember my RM account is the one I'm actually pointing to here.

26
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:12,388
So that's my automation account and it just enumerates all of the accounts inside the service.

27
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:20,388
But inside if your now all those runbooks are available to you, and so you can just open up one and just start

28
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:25,388
to reuse it. Let's see if I can. So this is a very simple one.

29
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:29,388
I was testing some output, but these could be any PowerShell, so you get all of the benefits of this,

30
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:33,388
and so you can author inside of here, but then you can also throw in some key vault stuff.

31
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:37,388
There's almost anything you want to do you would just normally do in PowerShell.

32
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:43,388
Author it here and you can test it, but then you can upload it to the draft, so you can see this is updated

33
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:48,388
locally, so I can just upload it directly into the service. And now it's in the service, but I can test it

34
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:54,388
here obviously just running it, but then I can also test it directly up in Azure because we put it into the service,

35
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:59,388
and so the identical script you author and tested here, you can push it to the service and just test it

36
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:07,388
directly inside of here and just off it goes. One thing I mentioned is you can test it either in Azure or if

37
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,388
you have a hybrid, you can cut it there as well. Alright, so let me jump out of

38
00:03:11,388 --> 00:59:59,999
here because I know we want to just finish up.
