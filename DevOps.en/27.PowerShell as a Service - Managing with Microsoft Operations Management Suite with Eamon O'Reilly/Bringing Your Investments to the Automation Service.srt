1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,919
Okay, so let me show you this. So bringing your investments into the automation service.

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,919
So now I want to tell you a story.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:15,919
So Sunday night, we were there at the hotel, the scripting life is like downstairs talking to about 20 or 40

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,919
different people that were like hanging around the bar area down there, yeah, and I went up and I was having

5
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:25,919
like some issues, so I sent Teresa an email and I said hey, I need you to come up to the room.

6
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:35,919
I need you to help me with my demo. And she goes, huh? I said yeah.

7
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:41,919
So why did I need her to help me with her demo? Well because she is an MVP, which means that she has a free Azure subscription.

8
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:51,919
So I wanted her to activate her Azure subscription, I wanted her to set up an automation account, and all of that.

9
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:56,919
So she did it and I didn't help here because I was like busy working on something else.

10
00:00:56,919 --> 00:01:02,919
And she did all of this and then of course, then she made the mistake after she put her credit card in and

11
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:10,919
made the mistake of giving me her credentials, so I said wahoo! So I'm lined up.

12
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:18,919
So that's why this actually, it is the scripting watch portal and Teresa is the automation account name.

13
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:26,919
Now one of the things that's really, really cool and we just introduced this recently, and so and I've got,

14
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:31,919
I'm going to be writing some OMST blog articles about this. So if you go back and you're looking at Azure

15
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:38,919
automation and some of the scripts and tried to automate some stuff, you'll see that there's a lot of stuff out there.

16
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:43,919
A lot of this stuff is kind of difficult to word I mean because it's using Azure cmdlets, it's using Azure

17
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:50,919
RM cmdlets, there's talks of different, talks about trying to get access to your particular subscription and

18
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:59,919
all of this stuff and all of that is pretty much a nightmare, especially if you're just trying to learn this stuff.

19
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:04,919
So what we did is we created a run as account and Teresa did this automatically.

20
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:09,919
I didn't even tell her to do this because the GUI, when you're setting stuff up, it's smart enough to say

21
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,919
hey do you want to create a run as account and she said yeah. Well once you create the run as account,

22
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:24,919
then it does three things for you. It creates a run as certificate, it takes your account that you use and

23
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,919
actually creates an account for that, it also saves your credentials as a credential object, and it makes a

24
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:40,919
connection to your default subscription. All of these things were issues before.

25
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,919
Okay.

26
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,919
It definitely solves a lot of that. I think if you tried this out, depends on your organization, a lot of times

27
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,919
you can't really use your user account because you might have to factor auth enabled, which won't work inside the service.

28
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,919
Whereas now, we basically take advantage of service principles inside of Azure ID and that's what we

29
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,919
create behind the scenes for you and then we do cert auth against those, so you can manage your certs and

30
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,919
then we add you as a contributor to the subscription, but you could go in and manage and change that

31
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:12,919
and do anything you want, but it just does all of this by default just by checking the box during creation right now.

32
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:20,919
Okay, so this is a little bit of code that Teresa did, yeah, and it's pretty.

33
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:30,919
So once you've done that, then you use Get-AutomationConnection and the name is the AzureRunAsConnection,

34
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,919
and then you add your Azure RM account, specify your service principle, you've got Tenant, the TenantID,

35
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,919
the ApplicationId, blah, blah, blah.

36
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,919
Now I say she wrote it. She wrote this probably the way that lots of you write code.

37
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,919
She found it and cut and pasted it, right. So the other thing that's really cool is that once you've set up this

38
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:56,919
run as account, it automatically does a demo test script---

39
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,919
It's a tutorial, yep---

40
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,919
to the tutorial and that's where this code came from. Okay, but now you just simply past this into all of

41
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:11,919
your other stuff. But you can see how easy it is to come over here.

42
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,919
So there's the code. She kind of cleaned it up a little bit, but so add your RM account, blah, blah, blah,

43
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,919
and that's all you really need. And then at that point, your scripts, you add this in and then your scripts

44
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:37,919
will just simply work. So let's go back over here and I want to show you two runbooks and these runbooks

45
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:47,919
are using this service principle and this one here. So this is it.

46
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,919
It's a workflow, okay. Workflows start VMs. Now the one thing is you're naming your workflow and the name

47
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,919
of your runbook, those names need to match, okay. You'll get an error message that'll be very obvious if

48
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,919
they don't work. So there's that code right there that Teresa wrote to make my connection and then the rest

49
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,919
of it, this is standard PowerShell. Basically, it's three lines of code 7, 8, and 9.

50
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
My VMs get the AzureRmVMs.

51
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,919
Now these are your new Azure VMs, not the classic mode ones. Okay.

52
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,919
If you're creating new VMs in Azure, you want to be using the new ones, not the classic ones.

53
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,919
The classic ones are stuff you created a long time ago.

54
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,919
So we get all of those stored in a variable and just simply use foreach, walk through the loop, VM,

55
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,919
and then Start-AzureRmVM, that's a tongue twister, and then give it the name and the resource group.

56
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,919
Okay, so Teresa created all of her resource servers in a resource group called server.

57
00:05:51,919 --> 00:06:00,919
Make sense, it's servers. So this starts them up and then the one that goes exactly with this is called

58
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:13,919
Stop-VMs basically. It helps, if I can tell you this, it helps if you create within your company a naming

59
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,919
convention and kind of stick to it. You see this is a stupid name.

60
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,919
But because I was wanting to figure out how to stop them because they were already running.

61
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,919
And as they're running, they're tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, just taking money out of your credit card.

62
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,919
So I wanted to figure out how to stop them really quick and I didn't want to do a bunch of clicky,

63
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,919
clicky things because I'm a PowerShell dude, right.

64
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,919
So workflow stop all of these. Now that obviously if I have more than a few, I'll be using foreach parallel

65
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,919
because this is a workflow, okay, but I didn't want to get things too complicated here.

66
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,919
If you know workflows, obviously you want it to know that one of the advantages is doing this stuff in parallel.

67
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:05,919
Same code, exact same code, cut and paste, but instead of Start-AzureRmVM, it was Stop-AzureRmVM.

68
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,919
So there's your two runbooks. Schedule them. This will help you when you start or you're playing with this

69
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:21,919
stuff doing your development and everything else, these two are going to save you some money guaranteed.

70
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,919
Start them up, shut them down. Now

71
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:31,919
not only that, let me show you this because I really and truly mean it when I say I really don't like mices.

72
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:44,919
Okay, so look what I did. Stop. So this is the schedule. I stopped these at, okay, so this is stop on

73
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:50,919
April the 7th, I'm going to stop these at what is it 7 am, is that what it says?

74
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:51,919
Yep.

75
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,919
Ah, different time zone. Okay. Different time zone. Okay.

76
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,919
So we're going to start these things at one time, we're going to stop them at another time.

77
00:08:02,919 --> 00:59:59,999
Okay and so they start up, I work, they shut down.
