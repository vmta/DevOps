1
00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:24,5
So low sodium, right, cloud, fat loss, right, there's all these marketing terms that get thrown around at us

2
00:00:24,5 --> 00:00:28,5
all the time and it becomes really easy to become immune to them.

3
00:00:28,5 --> 00:00:35,5
I mean, we're constantly having marketing stuff tossed at us. When cloud first kind of became a word in the

4
00:00:35,5 --> 00:00:43,5
IT industry right when we ripped it off from the telecoms, it had a real concrete useful technical meaning

5
00:00:43,5 --> 00:00:48,5
for about 10 minutes and then marketing people got a hold of it and ran away with it and suddenly everything

6
00:00:48,5 --> 00:00:52,5
was a cloud. You can get your own personal cloud, no that's a hard drive.

7
00:00:52,5 --> 00:00:56,5
It's not, it's hooked up to the internet sure, but that doesn't make it a cloud.

8
00:00:56,5 --> 00:00:59,5
So everybody kind of ran away with it and the same thing happened with DevOps.

9
00:00:59,5 --> 00:01:00,5
DevOps

10
00:01:00,5 --> 00:01:05,5
as a term has actually been around for quite a while. It didn't really start to catch on until a couple of

11
00:01:05,5 --> 00:01:09,5
really, really good books about it like the Phoenix project was kind of the definitive book that really got

12
00:01:09,5 --> 00:01:18,5
people's attention on it in a big way, I guess. A lot of .coms, startups in the current era of startups

13
00:01:18,5 --> 00:01:22,5
started using this type of an approach, so DevOps actually meant something

14
00:01:22,5 --> 00:01:31,5
and then the marketing people got a hold of it. And all of a sudden, it's we're DevOps, here's DevOps in a box

15
00:01:31,5 --> 00:01:37,5
and we being who we are and what we do for a living immediately started ignoring the word, justifiably, I think.

16
00:01:37,5 --> 00:01:44,5
And so I wanted to do this talk to kind of just it's a real thing.

17
00:01:44,5 --> 00:01:49,5
DevOps is not a marketing word. I want people to pay attention to this because it is a real thing; however,

18
00:01:49,5 --> 00:01:54,5
it isn't something you can buy in a box. It's not shrink wrapped, you can't just wake up one morning and go

19
00:01:54,5 --> 00:01:59,5
we should do DevOps, let's just do that. It's a massive cultural change.

20
00:01:59,5 --> 00:02:03,5
It's a massive philosophical change and how you decide to do IT.

21
00:02:03,5 --> 00:02:09,5
You can apply DevOps principles to one tiny project within your organization if it's got some certain

22
00:02:09,5 --> 00:02:16,5
boundaries around it that allow that. You can run your entire IT organization according to these principles.

23
00:02:16,5 --> 00:02:22,5
But you have to understand what it's supposed to achieve and you have to understand the tradeoffs that you

24
00:02:22,5 --> 00:02:25,5
have to agree to make if you're going to go down this route.

25
00:02:25,5 --> 00:02:31,5
And so, I've done a keynote a couple of times about really at a high level what DevOps is supposed to mean,

26
00:02:31,5 --> 00:02:39,5
what it's supposed to be, but I don't often talk about what it actually looks like in terms of a concrete

27
00:02:39,5 --> 00:02:46,5
what is this, if I'm doing this, how will I know, what's it look like, what buttons do I press to make DevOps turn on.

28
00:02:46,5 --> 00:59:59,999
And so that's what I wanted to do today. Talk about DevOps.
