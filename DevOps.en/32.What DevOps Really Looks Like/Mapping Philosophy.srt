1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,946
So the model you're describing so far my understanding you can bring node oriented and during Dekens talk about

2
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:14,946
VMware, it would be in that, Oh he had to instantiate a system to use its LCM to manage the rest of

3
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:19,946
the environment, so when you compare it to _____ software, the whole infrastructure had this scripted thing

4
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:22,946
talking about it wasn't just one node, it was all sorts of things.

5
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:25,946
How does DSC have it mapped to---?

6
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:34,946
So yeah, so this does not really talk about just one node. Take Elastic Beanstalk, for example, if you work

7
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:41,946
for a large company and you've got an enormous website, that push the button might be spinning up 300 VMs,

8
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:46,946
some of those might be a database, some of them might be front-end servers, it's the whole application.

9
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:54,946
Same thing here. Same thing here. You usually try to segment your environment into functional chunks,

10
00:00:54,946 --> 00:01:00,946
which we kind of do that anyway, right. I mean if you've got a three-tier application, you kind of have its

11
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:08,946
back-end and its middle tier and we try at least not to cross things, right, we want one server to basically

12
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:15,946
do kind of one role in the environment. Yeah, you might have machines that are AD and DNS and DHCP, but we call

13
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,946
those infrastructure servers and that's a role and we try not to put anything else on those, right.

14
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,946
And so, you can have multiple things happening as part of an operation.

15
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:30,946
You just try to put some role boundaries around it so that you can manage those things as a unit and I use

16
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:39,946
the virtual machine a lot. Might not be a VM, might be a container, might be client machines.

17
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:44,946
How many of you have ever screwed up a Group Policy? Because you're live editing the stupid things.

18
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:53,946
There's not a save button. I wonder what happens if I click, what's the screaming all about?

19
00:01:53,946 --> 00:02:00,946
So I mean we could absolutely apply these types of things to the existing infrastructure the way we already do things.

20
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:05,946
Remember, this is an approach, this is sort of a guidance on how to go about this.

21
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:09,946
It's not a fixed set of tools, it's not a fixed set of scenarios.

22
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:16,946
We can use examples using concrete things like DSC or Elastic Beanstalk, but those are just examples of the

23
00:02:16,946 --> 00:59:59,999
philosophy and that's really what this is. You can apply the philosophy to anything.
