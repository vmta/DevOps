1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,802
So comparison, before DevOps, your recovery and response took a long time.

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:12,802
The reason most companies are so fearful of failure is because when something does fail, it fails for a long time.

3
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:18,802
Right. Most of us can handle a stubbed toe because it heals in five minutes or so.

4
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:24,802
It's the broken leg that's a real pain because then you're in the chair for 10 weeks.

5
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:33,802
After DevOps, the recovery and response can be really fast. Failure becomes less serious because it's less impactful.

6
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:39,802
Before DevOps, everything was mission critical. How many of you have been told that email is mission critical?

7
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:41,802
That's bull.

8
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:48,802
I know it's inconvenient when email isn't up, but no one died. Okay.

9
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:54,802
There are places where nearly every application is mission critical and those places are called hospitals

10
00:00:54,802 --> 00:01:00,802
because people die when things break. If no one's going to die, then you can handle a failure for a few

11
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:06,802
minutes or an hour or whatever. I know it's inconvenient, but if you move over to a DevOps model, you can start

12
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:12,802
to realize that yeah not everything is so mission critical. We can afford to be down for a little while.

13
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:17,802
We can stomach a little inconvenience. What we couldn't stomach was yeah email is down, it's going to be down

14
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:22,802
for several hours and when it comes back up, everything's gone, right.

15
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:27,802
That's why everyone said oh it's mission critical. They didn't actually mean it is critical to our mission.

16
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:33,802
They meant I know when this fails, it's going to be biblical and we can't handle that.

17
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:40,802
Before DevOps, we know that change breaks things, so let's just not change, ever.

18
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:46,802
Let's implement a management framework that has an entire committee who sits down once a month to discuss how

19
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:56,802
they're not going to approve anything and we call that ITIL. After DevOps though, change is fine.

20
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:58,802
You can be more agile.

21
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:03,802
We have to change. We know we have to change. How many of you have organizations who from a business

22
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:12,802
perspective are just pressing IT to do it faster? Yeah. Maybe don't outsource your VM management to a

23
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:19,802
company that has a six-month spin up SLA, just as a suggestion. But they're pressing us because we need to

24
00:02:19,802 --> 00:59:59,999
be more agile and we can because change becomes less scary because we have a recovery plan that's fast and that'll work.
