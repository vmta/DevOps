00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,083
It's not marketing. It really is about dev, developers, and ops, operations, working together for a common

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:18,083
goal and that goal is to smooth out the path between the coder and whoever's consuming that code whether that's

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:24,083
users or it's a service or something else. That is a really, really, really, really important statement that

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:28,083
you almost can't go any further until you embrace that.

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:35,083
Let's look at what's involved in getting an application or a service from a coder out to its user.

6
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:44,083
For one, you have to start by coding it, right, and about the only way to code is to push your fingers against buttons.

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:49,083
That is a creative process. It's an artistic process. We can put a lot of tools in place to help make developers

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:54,083
more efficient, but at the end of the day, code comes from the human mind.

9
00:00:54,083 --> 00:01:00,083
And so you can only do so much to smooth that part of it out. So now the coder has finished, the coder has

10
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:06,083
hit compile, a miracle has occurred and now we have code. That's when ops traditionally takes over to get

11
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:10,083
the code wherever it's going to be. We're deploying it to a server, we're deploying it out to client

12
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:21,083
computers wherever it is. We are almost nothing but a hurdle, right, any effort that is greater than 0 means

13
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:27,083
we are slowing things down. In an ideal world, the coder would just be able to close his eyes and squint

14
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,083
really hard and then the code would appear wherever it was supposed to be, right, that's ideal.

15
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:38,083
That's impossible because developers don't have the psychic deployment powers like we do.

16
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:45,083
So anytime we get involved, we are automatically creating a barrier, so our goal is to work with the devs to

17
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:52,083
lower that barrier as much as possible given some reasonable things like we don't want the universe to blow

18
00:01:52,083 --> 00:59:59,999
up every time this happens. So, that's kindof what that is.
