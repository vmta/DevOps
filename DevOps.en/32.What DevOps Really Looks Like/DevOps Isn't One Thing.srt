DevOps is not just one thing. It's going to look different in every single organization.

2
00:00:05,5 --> 00:00:12,359
It's going to look different in nearly every single project, but let me just give you kind of a quick example

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,359
of how this probably will change your IT organization.

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:25,359
How many of you have separate dev and ops and maybe even like a network infrastructure team like fairly siloed IT?

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,359
That goes away. It has to. And this is where we have to look at whether our organization is willing to do this.

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:38,359
What it needs to be is not, how many users have walked into the office and said man, looking forward to

7
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:46,359
getting that IP address today? Never happens. We even fool ourselves.

8
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,359
Remember we went down this whole virtual desktop infrastructure?

9
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,5
How many users come in and say oh I love my desktop. Love it! They want their apps.

10
00:00:55,5 --> 00:01:01,359
They want their services. And so, we have to reorganize IT. If we're going to do DevOps, we've got to be

11
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,359
organized around apps and services. So what it can look like, for example, is here's the corporate application team.

12
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:19,359
It's got 10 developers and 2 ops guys and a network infrastructure guy and they work together on that.

13
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:26,359
And incidentally, those same two ops guys are also on this other project team because their lending their ops

14
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:33,359
expertise to that team and telling the developers look in order for us to really smooth this out and we're

15
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,359
all on this boat together, so let us help each other make it happen.

16
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,359
If you could put these two things into your code, we're going to be able to make it much quicker and easier

17
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,359
for everybody else, so let's do that. And they have access to that in real time and those guys float to

18
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:55,359
whatever projects they're assigned to. And then all the ops guys and all the infrastructure guys and all the

19
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,359
developers have a guild and that doesn't have anything to do with the project.

20
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,359
That's just where the network infrastructure guys all get together for lunch every month or so and say so

21
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,359
how's it going on all the projects? And one of them go yeah, you know what we really found out that this one

22
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:15,359
brand of switch that we're trying out, rocks. It's a little easier to manage, so as you guys start moving

23
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,359
into other projects, you might look at that. That was really successful.

24
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:23,359
And somebody else can say yeah, you know what, we figured out that router over here blows up every Tuesday

25
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:27,359
and all of our problems have been stemming from this one place, and so they share their domain knowledge with

26
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:34,359
each other, but they're not organized that way. You don't just have a bunch of people who are disconnected

27
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:43,359
from reality managing IP addresses in an Excel spreadsheet. You organize around what is delivering to the business.

28
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:49,359
And if you're going to do DevOps, even for a small project, the team has to look like that.

29
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:54,359
Everybody who's contributing to it needs to be in the boat. It's the only way you can make it work because

30
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,359
otherwise what do you end up with? You get these walls, you get these communication walls, you get these

31
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:05,359
direct report-to hierarchy org chart walls. It's not healthy. It's not conducive to getting the job done.

32
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,359
One thing you'll probably start noticing too is that the projects that fail is run by the same --- project.

33
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,359
Can we start cutting the fat?

34
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:18,359
Projects that fail all the time that have a common human resource element, you can start to look at that.

35
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,359
(Audience comment)

36
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,359
You do have to change how you think about this.

37
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,359
So where do you begin? Small.

38
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:34,359
Do not go home and say hey you know that one giant project that actually makes the entire company run every

39
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,359
single day, let's DevOps that sucker. Go find something little.

40
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,359
Find something low stakes because there's going to be a learning process.

41
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:45,359
You're going to have to build some tooling. You're going to have to experiment, see what works for your organization.

42
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:53,359
Experiment somewhere lower impact, less mission critical. Start small and then grow from there.

43
00:03:53,359 --> 00:04:00,359
And if you're, yeah I know, I work for a bank, we can't do, actually most of the companies that are really

44
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:06,359
leading DevOps right now are financial services companies because they're under such pressure to push out

45
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,359
websites and mobile apps and all this other stuff and this is the way they're actually getting it done,

46
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:16,359
so you can do it. How many of you are thinking yeah but my company is a little different?

47
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:23,359
No, you're not. All the companies are different. All of them. You're all equally weird in different ways

48
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:27,359
and that's why you're probably going to be building a lot of your own tools.

49
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:32,359
You might start with building components that somebody else that you buy, but you're going to glue everything

50
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:37,359
together on your own. You might go get a box of Legos, but you're going to put them together in your own way

51
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:45,285
and that's how you accommodate for your differences. That's why DevOps is not something that you can just

52
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:52,292
go buy at, do we have software stores anymore? Amazon, you can't buy DevOps at Amazon unless you're buying

53
00:04:52,292 --> 00:59:59,999
it from Amazon Web Services who does it quite well.
