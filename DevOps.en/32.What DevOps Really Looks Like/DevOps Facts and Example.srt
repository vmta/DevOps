1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,927
You are going to need tools though. You will either have to buy tools or build tools.

2
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:10,927
This is where the concrete implementation starts to come in because PowerShell it turns out is a great way to

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:16,927
build tools to help you achieve some of these goals and we'll talk about that.

4
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:23,927
Some DevOps facts. Puppet labs today a state of the DevOps report in 2015 and talked to a bunch of different

5
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:31,927
companies who are really, really all in with this approach, 60 times fewer failures, 60.

6
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:37,927
I want you to think of all the software deployment fails that you have had over the past year and if you're

7
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:43,927
thinking, yeah, it was about 60, well they just took it to 0. Sixty times fewer failures.

8
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:47,927
A hundred and sixty-eight times faster recovery when there is a failure.

9
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:48,927
Do that math.

10
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:56,927
If you had a failure that took 168 days to recover from, they just took it down to one day.

11
00:00:56,927 --> 00:01:04,927
That's a hugely important fact because part of DevOps is accepting the fact that you will have failures.

12
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:08,927
You are going to screw something up just like you have always screwed things up.

13
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:16,927
This is just acknowledging it and getting to a point where you can recover fast enough that it's not so painful

14
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:22,927
when you fail. It's called fail with style. Okay.

15
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:29,927
They got 30 times more deployments in the field, 30 times. That means instead of deploying something once

16
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:36,927
per year, you deployed it once every couple of weeks, which means you're now moving features,

17
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:42,927
you're removing bugs, you're getting code out to where it needs to be, you've massively improved the agility

18
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:48,927
of the business and the businesses ability to respond to changing conditions because you can react much faster.

19
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:52,927
Two hundred times shorter lead for deploying.

20
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:59,927
If it used to take you 200 days to get completed code out into the field, now it takes you 1 day.

21
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:04,927
If it used to take you 200 hours, now it takes you 1 hour. These are a big, big deal.

22
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:09,927
I mean, this is a massive change and there's a lot of benefits, but you have to acknowledge a few things,

23
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:16,927
so let's run through a quick example. How many of you are familiar with Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk?

24
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:21,927
Okay, just a few folks. Go read up on it. Now if your, oh my company will never, I don't care.

25
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:29,927
I'm not telling you to buy it. I'm telling you to go read up on it because this is the ideal text book definition

26
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:36,927
of what DevOps actually should look like. Amazon themselves has taken on the role of ops, they are the IT

27
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:42,927
operations department, and they have managed to remove almost all human interaction from the software

28
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:48,927
deployment process while still making it safe, fast, reliable, and predictable.

29
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,927
Here's how it works.

30
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:54,927
I'm a dev, okay. I'm writing my little web app that's going to get run in Amazon.

31
00:02:54,927 --> 00:03:00,927
Let's say it's in a PHP or whatever goofy crap kids use these days.

32
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:03,927
As part of that,

33
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:11,927
in a little folder, I have a text file and the text file describes the type of environment that I want my app

34
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:18,927
to run in. Whatever packages I need, whatever add ins, whatever DLLs, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

35
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:25,927
right, I need this much RAM, I need this type of processor, I need this type of OS, I need these things in it.

36
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:30,927
One of the biggest places where we fall down in deploying software, is that the damn developers never tell us

37
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,927
what's supposed to be running when we put it in production, right.

38
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:39,927
They sit in their little ivory tower world and are like oh wow my code didn't compile, oh I was missing this package,

39
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,927
I'll just install it. Look, it compiled and they don't ever clue us in the fact that package has to be there

40
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:46,927
for the code to work, right. And that's when we run into failure.

41
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:51,927
We push that sucker out live and it blows up into a million pieces because nobody actually wrote down what it

42
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:57,927
was we were supposed to deploying and when they do write it down, what's that deployment document look like?

43
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:02,927
You get like a Word doc, right, yeah it needs this and this and this or maybe it's a ticket.

44
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:07,927
It's not something we can consume easy. It's too easy for us to screw that up.

45
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:15,927
So in this model, the devs put a text document as part of their project and it's a text document I could read

46
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:24,927
and it's a text document that the computer can read. In Microsoft terms, we might call this a MOF, right.

47
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,927
So what happens is,

48
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:31,927
somebody says okay, let's deploy the app maybe to a test environment.

49
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:40,927
Maybe that's what we're going to do first. Amazon sucks in all the project code including that file,

50
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:47,927
it sets up the environment, it compiles the application, it injects the code into the virtual machine,

51
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:50,927
and then it starts running whatever automated tests you've set up.

52
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:59,927
This is key because the code only runs in an environment that was set up by the automation engine.

53
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:05,927
So if the developer forgot to specify something, his tests are going to fail and he can't just run in here

54
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:10,927
and oh yeah right, I forgot such and such a package. He's got to go back,

55
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:15,927
he's got to modify his configuration document to indicate what package was missing, he's got to

56
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:19,927
push the button again, the deployment engine will spin down the old environment and spin up a new

57
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:27,927
one that meets the new criteria, so by the time he gets it working, we know we've got this nailed.

58
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:33,927
So what Amazon literally does is you can ping their REST API or you can go into their dashboard and you can

59
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:41,927
say update app. It spins up however many virtual machines, sucks the source code into them,

60
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:46,927
configures those virtual machines, sets their memory, sets the processor class, installs whatever packages

61
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:52,927
you need, sets environment variables, registers those with the load balancer, deregisters the old ones,

62
00:05:52,927 --> 00:06:02,927
and then destroys the old ones. Everything that we're used to doing manually, they just got as a bunch of Python scripts.

63
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:08,927
We might do that with a MOF.

64
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:13,927
Maybe we just tell the developer look I'm going to teach you how to write DSC configuration scripts and you're

65
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:19,927
going to draw up a DSC configuration script in as part of your project.

66
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:26,927
And we go to deploy your project, I'm going to take that and I'm going to use it to create a MOF and that's

67
00:06:26,927 --> 00:59:59,999
how I'm going to configure the environment.
