00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:10,892
Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation. The Visible Ops Handbook and then

3
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:13,892
The Phoenix Project, which is actually a really good read. Mark, you have a?

4
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:21,892

5
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:26,892
