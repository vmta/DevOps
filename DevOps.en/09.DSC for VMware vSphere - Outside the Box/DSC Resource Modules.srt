1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,331
Then the modules themselves. Remember I said that I wanted to go for class modules, class base resources,

2
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:15,331
so I started in 5, one of the early previews in fact already, I started converting what I had,

3
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:23,331
a scripted resource to a class. Some guidelines that I, but not only for my DSC resources, I use this for all

4
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:26,331
my modules and scripts.

5
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:36,331
I love this region, hash region keyword in your code. It allows you to collapse and expand code, makes it more,

6
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:40,331
you can have a look from a high level on your code, so that's what I did here.

7
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:47,331
You see, for example, for my class folder, C, okay and I know that the C at the beginning is also under discussion.

8
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:54,331
I'm going to review that as well. That one I can understand that is perhaps a bit surpassed and that I should

9
00:00:54,331 --> 00:01:02,331
just call it VmwFolder in this case. But what you see is that I have three distinct regions in each class.

10
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,331
First of all, we have the properties. We will open it on the next slide.

11
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:10,331
Then you have the standard DSC functions your classical Get, Set, and Test.

12
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:17,331
And then, what I try to do and you will see also that in the next slide is the Get, Set, and Test should be rather simple.

13
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:22,331
So a lot of the functionality I packaged in helper functions. That's the start region.

14
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:26,331
We'll have a closer look at those now.

15
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:34,331
Okay, I hope this is somewhat visible, but just because, okay the first part that's approximately to the line

16
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:41,331
no, it's to the Line 28, that's my attributes, my properties, parameters that I want, no the properties of

17
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:50,331
the class, in this case, for the Forward class. There's a number in there that you absolutely need that

18
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:59,331
ensure the path, the name, and so on. There's the hidden one. Everybody knows what a hidden property is in a class.

19
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:07,331
You won't see it if you use the IntelliSense thing. The intention of that one is remember I wanted to use

20
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:10,331
this corrected sessions. That's the one where the session id would go, in fact.

21
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:16,331
So for the moment, since it's not working, I'm not using it, but that was the intention.

22
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:21,331
Also notice that there are credentials in there and I know that

23
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:29,331
we should be at a good session earlier, no first session this afternoon on the encrypting your complete MOF.

24
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:34,331
This is definitely something that I should be looking at. I haven't done it yet, but we should start

25
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:37,331
encrypting this stuff because there's quite a lot of security in there.

26
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:44,331
You have your connectivity to your vSphere server, which you don't want to be seen in public or on the

27
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,331
network where everybody can snoop.

28
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:52,331
Then the next region is like I said, the Set, Test, and Get functions.

29
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:58,331
They are quite simple in this case. In fact, they only contain the functionality to return the correct result,

30
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:03,331
if they return the result at all. And then you have a number of helper functions at the bottom of the start

31
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:11,331
region that I used.

32
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:20,331
Okay, this is the part where I will set back, quite recently in fact, I had the multiple psm1 files that

33
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:26,331
didn't work out, so I had to go back and start using the RootModule in the manifest and put everything,

34
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:31,331
all my resources, all my classes in one psm1 file unfortunately.

35
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:37,331
I hope this is a temporary issue and that it will get fixed at some point because for source control reasons,

36
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:42,331
it's a lot easier if I have it in separate files if I work on the folder class.

37
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:48,331
Now I have to import and commit everything again, then I would just be able to do it on the part that I'm

38
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:56,331
actually working with. So if you start using it or if you start writing it, remember at the moment you can

39
00:03:56,331 --> 00:59:59,999
only do it in one psm1 file unfortunately.
