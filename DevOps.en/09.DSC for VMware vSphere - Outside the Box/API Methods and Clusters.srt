1
00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:07,838
Another thing that I started using quite early is I dropped all use of the PowerCLI cmdlets and I think I

2
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:13,838
mentioned it earlier I went immediately for the API methods. Okay, API methods.

3
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:18,838
Who of you is using the Onyx WebClients or has heard of the Onyx WebClients?

4
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:24,838
So there's a feature where you can see all these API calls underneath the PowerCLI cmdlets.

5
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:30,838
It's a handy feature if you want to write some advanced functions and don't know what they are actually calling.

6
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:35,838
So that is the kind of stuff that you will see appearing if you start using this Onyx WebClient,

7
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:43,838
so you see over the deep down APIs and properties. In this case, what I'm doing here I'm just adding a

8
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:51,838
VMHost and ESXi node to, or standalone server, or one to a cluster, instead the if statement at the end.

9
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:58,838
So based on what leaf type was returned, if it's a cluster that was returned, we can use the AddHost method

10
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:06,838
if it's not a cluster by definition it a standalone server, then we need to use this other method with

11
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:11,838
somewhat different parameters.

12
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:20,838
So a lot of the resources that you will see when I make this public, all of them, in fact, are real API calls

13
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:30,838
and API objects that I'm using. And the reason I'm doing that is like I set this for speed, but also to have more features.

14
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:34,838
But the API methods, I can do everything. There's a lot, there's some stuff with them, but the cmdlets

15
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:40,838
that is not possible.

16
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:46,838
What I also used as a guideline and I think I mentioned an example earlier, if you look at the cluster in the

17
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:53,838
VMware environment, the cluster has multiple components. We have high availability, DRS, DPM.

18
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:58,838
All of these in turn have a lot of parameters that you can use to configure these components.

19
00:01:58,838 --> 00:01:59,838
On the other hand,

20
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:04,838
if you got to the WebClient or the vSphere client, you can just right-click on the datacenter new cluster

21
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:10,838
and it doesn't ask you a lot of questions. It just asks you, do you want HA enabled, DRS enabled, DPM.

22
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,838
That's it. So what I decided quite early on

23
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:20,838
in writing these classes is I would go for the same approach. If you define a resource, a new cluster in

24
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:26,838
this case, no not in this case, but if you would define a new cluster, you would get all the defaults.

25
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:33,838
And a configuration of HA or DRS or DPM would be a separate resource, but the dependency on the cluster,

26
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:40,838
of course, but I would separate the complexity that way, so that's why I called this slide, keep it simple.

27
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:41,838
So I'd rather

28
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:47,838
work with all these different resources with dependencies in between them, than making one big resource with

29
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:58,838
tens or hundreds of parameters, which is quite complex to code and manage.

30
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:07,838
So where am I now? At the moment, I have a number of resources that are tested and available.

31
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:13,838
Those are the ones that I will publish when I'm back home from this event.

32
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:20,838
It's the standard stuff, folder, datacenter, we have cluster, we have VMHost in there, we have datastore in there.

33
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:28,838
There's one component missing that you would need if you want to actually start using it, meaning start creating

34
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:34,838
VMs as your network part. VSS standard switches is quite obvious.

35
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:39,838
This one is under the development. Distributed switches is a bit further away in the future, I'm afraid.

36
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:48,838
That is quite complex object, but it's on my to do list. So what I'm working on at the moment is the networking part.

37
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:58,838
Like I said, I will publish this quite shortly after I'm back and since the environment is quite complex,

38
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:06,838
I can't do that all by myself, so what I want to do is publish this, give you an idea how it can be done,

39
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:13,838
so there would, by definition, need to be a lot of community effort to make this complete, to be able to

40
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:20,838
configure your complete vSphere environment based on DSC resources in this case.

41
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:24,838
Like I said also in the beginning, I'm not going to show you a lot of code.

42
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:30,838
I have my ISE editor open. If some of you want to see some of the code or have specific questions, feel free

43
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:37,838
to come up after this session or anywhere in the next coming days, I'm happy to run through it and discuss

44
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:48,838
with you what even, even though I prefer to listen to your suggestions on how some of this stuff should be done.

45
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:57,838
Quick question here. If you have available vSphere DSC resources, how many would consider actually using that?

46
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:03,838
And is that no problem with your environment that they say this is external or we don't trust it.

47
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:09,838
Would you have to do a validation? Would you prefer or would you require passive built-in tests?

48
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:15,838
Yeah. If a structure testing. So something that made available if it comes with infrastructure testing

49
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:21,838
that would be more acceptable than just the resources. Yes. Okay, great.

50
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:30,838
So that's new point on my to do list then or anybody else who wants to volunteer for that part.

51
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:37,838
In fact, that's what I wanted to say in this presentation. There's another one on Wednesday where I will

52
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:45,838
start looking or when I will look at the reverse part because a lot of you will have existing vSphere environments.

53
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:50,838
Now how do you get from an existing vSphere environment to a configuration file?

54
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:54,838
That is the interesting part. You're not going to write, I'm not going to write them from scratch,

55
00:05:54,838 --> 00:59:59,999
so that's for Wednesday. And in fact, this brings me to the end of my session for today.
