1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,036
So these were a few of the concepts. I had to drop some temporarily, I hope.

2
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:14,036
But I started working on this thing and this is just a screenshot to give you an idea of my lab.

3
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:18,036
It's not a home lab anymore. It's sitting in the cloud nowadays, so I can access it here.

4
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:25,036
I can access it at home. It's a cloud lab. The setup is quite simple.

5
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:32,036
I have a very simple Windows environment, one domain controller, one pull server.

6
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:39,036
I have a workstation. I use 10 and 8 to be able to test both flavors of VMF5.

7
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:46,036
And then I have the famous vEngine and I have a very small separate vSphere environment, in this case,

8
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:54,036
it's a VCSA, a couple of ESXi nodes, and some storage. I use FreeNas at the moment because that's the

9
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:59,036
simplest to set up for me.

10
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:06,036
Okay, most of this is, I already mentioned in the previous slides, it was a bumpy road, so like I said I

11
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:11,036
often felt that I took one step forward, two steps backwards, but there was progress.

12
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:19,036
Ultimately, there was progress, especially when RTMF5 RTM became available or available again in February

13
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:29,036
that I could continue actually progressing on my DSC resources. Most of it what I mentioned here

14
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:34,036
is already mentioned on the previous slides.

15
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:42,036
Okay, the virtual, the vEngine box, I started configuring that with the RegistrationKey.

16
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:50,036
I think most of you know, or if you didn't, you heard it in previous sessions today how you can use this RegistrationKey.

17
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:56,036
I think the next slide will show you how it works with your,

18
00:01:56,036 --> 00:02:02,036
okay, so you update your Web.config, you point to this RegistrationKey's text, there you put this

19
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:11,036
registration key, so it simplifies your registration, in my opinion, of your machine, of your DSC client with

20
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:19,036
the pull server. This is just background info. For the rest, it doesn't impart your DSC, vSphere DSC

21
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:27,036
resources normally, but that's how I set it up just to make it simple, what I think is simple in this case.

22
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:34,036
Then the partial configurations on the discussions as I said, but what I'm doing there is I tried, and that was

23
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:37,036
one of my arguments to use partial configuration, alright.

24
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:42,036
What we noticed or what I noticed in my environment that the people who manage your storage and the people

25
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:48,036
who manage your network, they start managing your virtual storage and your virtual network nowadays and they

26
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:54,036
aren't necessarily your virtual environment administrator, otherwise, your vSphere administrators.

27
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:59,036
I thought if we pull that apart, it would be easier than the network part how you configure your switches,

28
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:04,036
what settings are on there that would go to your network team, same for the storage part.

29
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:11,036
Same for the virtualization part, the virtual server itself, the cluster and so on that would go to your

30
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:15,036
virtualization administrator or whatever you want to call them in your environment.

31
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:23,036
So hence this separation. This is just a small sample where I have folders and datacenters and clusters in

32
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:31,036
separate part of configurations. And thanks to the DependsOn, we could then determine somewhat what should

33
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:37,036
be there, so you should have a datacenter present before you define a cluster if you're cluster is in a

34
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:46,036
datacenter, of course. So those simple dependencies can easily be configured in this way, so that's what I

35
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:52,036
was playing and still playing with at the moment.

36
00:03:52,036 --> 00:04:01,036
This is once you launch this through your vEngine, this is the LCM configuration on that vEngine.

37
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:07,036
Nothing world shattering in there. It's what you saw several times today, I suppose.

38
00:04:07,036 --> 00:59:59,999
It's a very straightforward standard thing configuring LCM.
