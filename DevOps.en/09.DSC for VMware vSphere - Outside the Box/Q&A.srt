1
00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:09,553
Are there any questions? Yep. (Audience question) Sorry, can you? Have you gotten some extra VMs themselves,

2
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:17,553
CPUs, memory VA, just substantial things like that? If I write the resource for the VM, yeah, that will be.

3
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:22,553
Have you got there yet? No, that's what I said. I first need to network before I can actually create a VM.

4
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:28,553
I know and I think Brandon is in the audience, he has a resource where you can create a VM.

5
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:33,553
I wanted to start from the bottom-up, he started from top-down, so that's, but I hope that we can reuse some

6
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:37,553
of his code in this environment.

7
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:44,553
Anymore questions? Okay, yeah. Can you see this getting rid of the need for profiles completely?

8
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:53,553
Yeah, I know what the question is. I got this. Does this eliminate the need for host profiles?

9
00:00:53,553 --> 00:01:00,553
We got that exact same question at the VMworld where the question was more painful than when I have it here, of course.

10
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:05,553
In my opinion, and since I'm not working for VMware, yes this will eliminate your need for host profiles

11
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:13,553
because this will do a lot more. But my good mate who works for VMware, he will tell you, ah no, not completely,

12
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:18,553
you still will need host profiles. (Audience comment) He's convinced of that, but he can't say that you

13
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:29,553
don't need host profiles. So yes, I think if this is working and it is working 100%, you could because with

14
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:34,553
host profiles it's a passive thing. If we get this working, that's an active thing.

15
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:40,553
That's why I would like this monitoring correct. I don't need to suspect a drift and then take action.

16
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:51,553
I want this stuff to discover the drift and correct it. For the correcting mechanism, would you be putting

17
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:56,553
host in a maintenance mode, moving VMs? That could be one of the options here.

18
00:01:56,553 --> 00:02:01,553
In fact, what I'm looking at is just writing the resources that would give you that possibility.

19
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:06,553
It would still be you who writes the configuration files. Yeah. Who decides how far this correction of

20
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:19,553
drift can go. Yep. Anybody else? Okay. I thank you. I know this is the last session of the day and my brain

21
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:24,553
was melted with the previous one, so I guess some of you would also be very tired now.

22
00:02:24,553 --> 00:59:59,999
Okay, thanks for coming and enjoy.
