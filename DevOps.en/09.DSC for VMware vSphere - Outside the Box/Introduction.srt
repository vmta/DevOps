00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:19,19
Okay. Welcome. I'm glad to see there are still people awake after this day of brain-melting sessions,

2
00:00:19,19 --> 00:00:26,26
at least for me. I learned quite a lot of stuff. I hope this brings a bit of new stuff or gives you a better

3
00:00:26,26 --> 00:00:31,31
insight in what we're going to talk about.

4
00:00:31,31 --> 00:00:37,37
I'm probably a bit of the odd one out. Since you saw the title, I'm talking about VMware vSphere.

5
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:42,42
First of all, are there many vSphere users in the audience? Okay, oh wow.

6
00:00:42,42 --> 00:00:52,52
Great. As you probably know, I'm quite keen on PowerShell and more specifically, on PowerCLI, which is the

7
00:00:52,52 --> 00:01:01,61
snap-in and nowadays nearly all modules, but there's still a few snap-ins left to manage your vSphere environment.

8
00:01:01,61 --> 00:01:07,67
Just a minute.

9
00:01:07,67 --> 00:01:15,75
Okay, this slide this is a big thank you from the complete PowerShell community and users to the guys who

10
00:01:15,75 --> 00:01:22,82
made all of this possible for it's now 10 years ago and without them, we wouldn't be here and we wouldn't

11
00:01:22,82 --> 00:01:28,88
have this marvelous tool to automate and manage our environment, so thank you guys.

12
00:01:28,88 --> 00:01:31,91
Much appreciated.

13
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:37,97
What am I going to do today here? First of all, it's 4:00, so I'm not going to show you hundreds of lines

14
00:01:37,97 --> 00:01:44,104
of codes and I want to avoid the snoring in the room after 5 minutes in, so we'll keep it very light.

15
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:52,112
What I'm trying to go for is DSC, Desired State Configuration. This was something we're all looking at probably.

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:58,118
It's very interesting. There are a number of reasons why you would use that and my question, already some time

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:03,123
ago was why wouldn't we use this for our VMware vSphere environment?

18
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:11,131
Now unfortunately, at the moment, there aren't any public DSC resources available that will allow you to do that

19
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:18,138
and that's where I'm going to try and help or start at least because this is definitely something that will

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:25,145
be so huge once it is usable that it's not a one-person job. So what will happen is I will push some stuff

21
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:33,153
into the community and I hope there will be some participation from the community on setting up the DSC resources.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:45,165
The agenda is very straightforward. I'll just tell you about the long and winding road that's in fact especially winding.

23
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
Although, I like

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:56,176
all the WMF5 previews, I've felt often like one step ahead and two steps backwards, so stuff that you thought

25
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:03,183
was implemented wasn't implemented or didn't exactly work as you expected it to work, but now with RTM,

26
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:10,190
I think we reached the stage where we can start actually using this environment, the 5 version I mean.

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,194
The 4 was already available long before that.

28
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:22,202
For those, this is a quick introductory stuff. Who is this guy on stage, that's me, look ridiculous.

29
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,207
I'm from Belgium, so I had a bit of a trouble to get here, but okay, we got here in the end.

30
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:35,215
I appear from time to time at VMworld. We have this PowerCLI reference for those of you that are busy with vSphere.

31
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
I suppose you know that book.

32
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:45,225
Second edition just came out last February, so the shameless plug, go, and get it, but okay it's up to you.

33
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:53,233
I'm most of the time, as you can see on the right I put some pictures with my partner in crime, Alan Renouf,

34
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,238
which is probably also well known. Who, by the way, is using his vCheck module here?

35
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:04,244
Okay, that's not as much as we normally, but okay great. If you don't know it, you should check it out.

36
00:04:04,244 --> 00:59:59,999
It allows you to schedule reports of your complete vSphere environment.
